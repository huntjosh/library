In situations where a good woman is expected to remain silent, literature can provide an important medium for the expression of deeply-felt and sometimes shocking views. In this anthology the award-winning author Yvonne Vera brings together the stories of many talented writers from different parts of Africa.

Characters reveal dignity and doubt in extraordinary situations, including a grandmother who abandons her frail husband in order to carry her grandchildren to safety in Nadine Gordimer's powerful \"The Ultimate Safari.\" J. M. Coetzee's \"Nietverloren\" examines the changing face of Africa through the demise of a small family farm. Binyavanga Wainaina's \"Discovering Home,\" meanwhile, contrasts a young man's year at home in Kenya after several years of cosmopolitan Cape Town life. Despite a rich diversity of style and subject matter, each story, as described in Ben Okri's introduction, \"reveals what hides in people,\" offering intimate glimpses into an array of African lives.

The stories are engaging, and the free-verse translations are surprisingly readable.... Recommended for all academic collections.\" &#151; Choice<P>Western culture traces its literary heritage to such well-known epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey and Gilgamesh. But it is only recently that scholars have turned their attention toward capturing the rich oral tradition that is still alive in Africa today.

These pieces span the centuries from 1711 to 2003, address topics ranging from religion to HIV and represent prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, lullabies and protest songs. Marriage is a theme that runs throughout: \"A Mother's Advice and Prayer\" from 1858 is a nuptial manual in verse, and \"I Want a Divorce,\" taken from a 1922 court record, gives a valuable glimpse of the power struggles between husband and wife. On a lighter note, a collection of recent song lyrics complains about useless husbands and lovers. Many 20th-century writers address colonialism and independence: Penina Muhando Mlama's \"Creating in the Mother-Tongue\" looks at the linguistic, literary and socioeconomic obstacles to writing in indigenous languages. The editors' lucid introduction usefully contextualizes these wonderful writings, and this volume will be especially welcome in college classrooms. General readers who want to be entertained, educated and chastened about women's struggles and triumphs in east Africa will delight in this literary feast. <I>(July)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Patrick Henry Bass</h4>Cultural critic Kevin Powell's <i>Step into a World</i> is a watershed moment in hip-hop writing, a thought-provoking book with a broad range of voices, from Ben Okri to Junot Didaz. <br>\n— <i>Essence</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This anthology of young, contemporary black writers generally maintains a precarious balance between authentic discovery and promotional marketing, although the writing varies widely in quality and relevance (some selections are quite riveting, others just self-absorbed). Divided into six sections--\"Essays,\" \"Hip-Hop Journalism,\" \"Criticism,\" \"Fiction,\" \"Poetry,\" and \"Dialogue\"--the collection presents a broad range of voices and perspectives, although a majority of them are, not surprisingly, from the United States. While some of the texts, particularly those on hip-hop, seem overly dramatic and hyperbolic, some very fine writing emerges in the \"Essays\" section. Mostly autobiographical, these selections address the very real contemporary problems of black identity in a post-Civil Rights era in which the political battle lines have become much more blurred and the issues of self, nation, class, gender, sexuality, and history are immensely complicated. The items in the \"Dialogue\" section are the most strident and the most inventive and compelling. Even though this book will mainly be used as a classroom textbook, it could be a valuable addition to larger collections and other libraries interested in offering brief introductions to young black writers.--Roger A. Berger, Everett Community Coll., WA Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967.

In this fascinating retrospective collection, she shares her personal journey through the social and political landscapes of the 1980s, with its recollected moments of struggle and transformation along the way. Written in a variety of styles and voices, ranging from anecdotal memory to historical moment to folklore tradition, these simply presented poems and stories are by turns funny, touching, chilling, thought-provoking and absorbing. Love Child is a collection for the new millennium generation. It is valuable not just for the deeply-felt personal and political insights it has to offer, but for the accessible ease with which it manages to capture the seminal moments of black South African history in the preserving amber of the author's personal recollection.</p>",

Each of the 120 texts in the volume is accompanied by a scholarly note that provides detailed background information, while an introductory essay sets the broader historical stage. Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form.</p>",
      "excerpt": "",
      "synopsis": "<p><P>An essential text for libraries&#151;the definitive collection of women's literatures from southern Africa.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>This rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>"

      "overview": "<p>Female characters who suffer madness and insanity are strikingly prominent in novels by women writers of Africa and the Caribbean. To find out why there are so many \"suffocated hearts and tortured souls\" in this literature, Valerie Orlando, who has long studied Francophone text and culture, here closely reads the work of Aminata Sow Fall, Mariama Bâ, Myrian Warner-Vieyra, and Simone Schwarz-Bart, among others. In these women's novels, Orlando finds, madness is the manifestation of a split identity, and in this study she sets herself the task of interrogating the nature of that identity. Francophone women novelists of Africa and the Caribbean—though they come from countries whose unique experiences of colonialism, revolution, and postcolonial regimes have shaped specific and discrete cultures—express a common search for a meaningful relationship between their experience as women to the history and destiny of their nations. Only when \"woman\"' is understood not as an ahistorical object but as a subject whose lived body is entwined with political, cultural, and economic structures, Orlando argues, will insanity finally give way to clarity of being. Interweaving literary citations with theoretical discussion, Suffocated Hearts and Tortured Souls is just as much a masterful explication of profoundly affecting literary work as it is an essential addition to feminist scholarship and theory.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><p>Harrow's provocative book introduces a psychoanalytic dimension to the study of African women's writing. In so doing, he opens up relatively uncharted terrain in African literary studies. Comprehensive, nuanced, occasionally lyrical, the book covers an impressive range of hitherto neglected francophone novels that are examined alongside canonical anglophone texts. The author places these texts in their colonial and postcolonial contexts, developing upon, and linking, structuralist theories of colonialism and patriarchy. This study offers a radical new position for those scholars who have long sought alternatives to the liberal humanist bias pervading many studies of African women's writing.<p>Students often struggle with the models employed by feminist and postcolonial theorists such as Judith Butler and Homi Bhabha. The clarity with which Harrow explains the positions of such theorists makes his book an essential companion to, and commentary upon, their publications. Kenneth Harrow's study will be of interest not only to African literature specialists, but also to non-literary scholars concerned with questions about feminism, gender construction, colonialism, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial theory.<p></p>",

He wrote this collection of biblical story-poems, which he published in 1946, in the voices of West African teachers and students.

There are also a few selections from the New Testament, among them, \"Make glad all people / God's pican be born in Bethlehem.\" The word pican, with its racist associations to picaninny, may be a problem with some readers, but as Graham explains in his introduction, the original word, meaning baby, son, or child, was used with great tenderness up and down the West African coast. It would be a shame to deprive today's children of this newly illustrated collection, endorsed by leading black authors, educators, and political leaders, because of the occasional use of this word. Most beautiful is the story of the Prodigal Son, told with a dramatic simplicity that's just right for readers' theater: the wastrel son's return and celebration, the good son's complaint to his father (\"I work, I work, I work, I never left you. All the time you never kill one small goat for me. How you do me so?\"), and the moving reply (\"He was dead and now he live. He ain't got nothin. And he hungry\").

A book to share across generations.<br>\n—(<i>Booklist</i>)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Children&#039;s Literature</h4>These poems, first published in 1946, are at times profound or humorous, but each reflects the uncomplicated view of an African child recounting the Biblical stories in his own way. As Graham presents the poems, the reader (or better the listener) is aware of the importance of the oral tradition in the West African culture. Graham, a missionary to West Africa in the 1920s, heard the stories and wanted others to share them. In this newly published edition, Ashley Bryan adds detailed black-and-white blockprints to offer visual images to accompany the text. Each story is accompanied by one full-page print. Because of the dialect used by Graham, these stories lend themselves to being read aloud or told. One might question the use of dialect, but Graham's introduction presents the origin of the dialect and offers the proper argument for its use. This new edition would be a worthy addition to a body of African literature. 2000 (orig. 1946), Boyds Mills Press, Ages 5 to 8, $17.95. Reviewer: Jenny B. Petty\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Gr 4 Up-A newly illustrated edition of a 1946 title. Using the vernacular English of West Africa in the 1920s, Graham eschewed \"Uncle Remus\" phonetic spelling, but preserved the idiomatic and idiosyncratic grammar of Sudanic coastal groups (Mandingo, Golah, Kru). Excerpts may sound awkward (\"Now you mens they dead,\" Naomi tells Ruth), but the ear catches on quickly to the meaning of the phrases sung in poetic rhythms. Biblical order is not followed, so the Prodigal Son appears between two Moses episodes, rather than as a Christian parable; only brief accounts of the Nativity, the lost boy-Jesus, and the loaves and fishes come from the New Testament. All of the stories focus on relationships. There is unexpected humor (Goliath's question to David, \"Do you mommy know you out?), drama (Goliath's protracted fall), and poignancy (David's mourning). Solomon's wisdom; Joshua's leadership; and the stories of Joseph, Esther, Job, Elisha, and Cain and Abel are among those memorably retold. Bryan's blockprints communicate a simplicity and strength in harmony with the text. Highly decorative in their intricate design, they also recognize the central character and dramatic moment in each story: Daniel embracing the lions, Isaac embracing Jacob. This book conveys a distinctive flavor of West African culture, and offers fresh, piquant seasoning for familiar Bible tales.-Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><p>A white knight meets his half-black half-brother in battle. A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of <B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B>.<p> <p>This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from <I>Arabian Nights</I> and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume.<p> <p><B>An Anthology of Interracial Literature</B> allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning.<p> <p>Contributors include&#58; Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.<p></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sollors (English literature & Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, \"It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics.\" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967. As stated in a Rita Dove play: \"A sniff of freedom's all it takes to feel history's sting.\" Recommended for academic libraries and for any reader working around the race rubric.-Scott Hightower, Fordham Univ., New York Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.</p>",

AMONG THE BLACKS consists of two works: Ron Padgett's translation of Raymond Roussel's early story \"Parmi les noirs,\" first published in 1935 in his book Comment j'ai ecrit certain de mes livres, together with Padgett's memoir focusing upon his own experience among black people. Roussel's story, about a master mariner named White who encounters an African chief named Booltable, is built upon the kind of whimsical and extravagant word play (its first and last sentences are identical except for one letter in one word--\"pooltable\"/ \"Booltable\") for which Roussel was idolized by the French Surrealists. In contrast, as he writes in his Afterword, Padgett's memoir \"grew out of the nagging need to come to grips with the frustrations of being a white American who had grown up in a racist environment and who, despite his rejections of racism at an early age, had rarely felt unselfconscious in the company of a black person.\" \"What he leaves us with is a work that is like the perfectly preserved temple of a cult which has disappeared without a trace, or a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered. But even though we may never be able to 'use' [Roussel's] work in the way he hoped, we can still admire its inhuman beauty, and be stirred by a language that seems always on the point of revealing its secret, of pointing the way back to the 'republic of dreams' whose insignia blazed on his forehead\"--John Ashbery.",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Starred Review. \n<p>Eight-time Emmy-winner Stewart (America: The Book) seeks to expand his audience to aliens who might land on earth after the extinction of the human race and be puzzled over the artifacts we've left behind. \"Greetings... on behalf of not only ourselves, but the entire Viacom family,\" he writes in this laugh-out-loud, rollicking social satire. In place of skits there are elaborate, color illustrations accompanied by captions written with his trademark deadpan humor; for instance, a photo of a mother and baby-elephant holds the caption, \"advances in contraception and industrialized food production allowed modern couples to have fewer offspring, while leaving the total weight of families constant.\" Nothing is off-limits here, not even Benjamin Franklin, whose pithy saying \"Nothing is certain but death and taxes\" Stewart expands upon. The book ends with a plea to the aliens to reconstruct the human race from DNA in the hope that, with guidance from the visitors, \"we could overcome the baser aspects of our nature... and give this planet the kind of caretakers it deserves,\" revealing the tears behind Stewart's clown.

All rights reserved.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>E.W.com</h4>Has it really been a full six years since Jon Stewart and the writers of <i>The Daily Show</i> released their last book? Well, the delay's understandable. It's a daunting task to cover the history of a 4.5 billion-year-old planet (including the entirety of human existence) in 244 pages.\n<p>You'll recognize <i>Earth's</i> faux-textbook design and irreverent tone from <i>America (The Book),</i> and some gags recur nearly unchanged — the terrifyingly nude bodies of the Supreme Court justices are replaced here with the terrifyingly nude body of Larry King. But the subject's bigger, and the high concept higher. <i>Earth</i> is written as a Baedeker for the aliens who will eventually discover our planet after our species has expired, likely by our own hand. All the entries, hitting topics like love (''liking another person very very very very very very much'') and work (''that which we didn't want to do, but had to, if we didn't want to eat dirt''), are written in the past tense. It's the ultimate gallows humor: We had it pretty good, and now we're all dead.</p>\n<p><i>Earth</i> is The Devil's Dictionary for a new generation, twisting our lives in the light and bringing mordant humor to the commonplace. Despite the timelessness of most topics, the writers manage to be pretty lively at times, such as when they refer to the Grand Canyon as ''the biggest rift in Arizona not involving Mexicans.''</p>\n<p> <i>Earth</i> isn't meant to be read straight through. It's designed to be perused, so you can discover at your leisure all the fun gags and wordplay crammed into its nooks and crannies. Because there are a lot. Enough, in fact, to make you believe this would actually be a fairly comprehensive guide for extraterrestrial visitors, just so long as they have a sense of humor. A–--(Staskiewicz, Keith)</p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Following the 2004 Publishers Weekly Book of the Year America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction—the Hachette Audio version of which won a Grammy Award—Stewart and the writers of his celebrated Daily Show together narrate this satirical overview of humanity written as though it were being explained to aliens of the future who discover Earth after the demise of all human life. Stewart, the primary narrator, explains religion, history, commerce, government, customs, and society in his trademark delivery. Unfortunately, he often swallows his punch lines, thus defeating the efficacy of many of the jokes. Perhaps his brand of humor is better suited to television. Nonetheless, this is a timely and entertaining title sure to do well among Stewart's many fans, who will doubtless laugh along. Recommended. [The Grand Central hc was a No. 1 New York Times and LJ best seller; see the review of the Grand Central hc, also in this issue, p. 122.—Ed.]—J. Sara Paulk, Wythe-Grayson Regional Lib., Independence, VA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4><p>A goofy guide to our planet, with literate ironist Stewart (<em>America: The Book</em>, 2004) at the helm.</p>\n<p>Continuing in the vein of<em>America</em>, but with a touch more detail in both words and images, Stewart and his<em>Daily Show</em>comrades posit that someday soon the ETs we've been hailing for all these decades will arrive—only to find us gone. And why would we not be here? Well, Stewart relegates the possible answers to an appendix that opens, \"At some point between the time this was written and the time you are reading it, we perished.\" Some of those possibilities include ecological catastrophe, nuclear holocaust, disease, robot rebellion and rapture—the last with a generous 30:1 chance of occurring, and evidenced by an \"overall 'Jesus-y' feeling in the air.\" To gauge by the rest of the book, however, the end may well come by dint of our soufflé-like culture's having finally become too airy and collapsed. So it is that<em>Earth</em>is studded with images of all those pop-culture and media figures that one would gladly leave the planet to escape, from Bernie Madoff to Nicole Kidman and J-Lo (or, if not J-Lo, a convincing simulacrum). Stewart lampoons with a broad brush rather than the scalpel with which he dissects pomposity and prevarication on his Comedy Central show. Some of his targets include creationists and school boards, fast-food restaurants, obesity, the medical bureaucracy, the Venus of Willendorf and, not connected to the aforementioned Venus, the use of the brassiere as an instrument of social control. George Bush doesn't escape, of course; but then, neither does Florence Henderson.</p>\n<p>The legions of readers of<em>America</em> will know exactly what they're in for—and readers of whatever stripe, save those who are fans of McDonald's and Satan, are likely to enjoy this one.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Janet Maslin</h4>Like the \"Daily Show\" this parody delivers wittily framed absurdities in a sweetly deadpan way…like the show, [it's] best when it takes on subjects of real substance…That's why the funniest material is about religion and science.<br>\n—The New York Times\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><P>David Wagoner writes about regular lives with plain grace and transcendent humanity, and the seventy-five poems he has chosen for the 2009 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> grapple with life, celebrate freedom, and teem with imaginative energy. With engaging notes from the poets, Wagoner's superb introductory essay, series editor David Lehman's astute foreword about the current state of poetry and criticism, and cover art from the beloved poet John Ashbery, <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i> is a memorable and delightful addition to a series dedicated to showcasing the work of poets at their best.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>From the moment series editor David Lehman invokes the myth of Jacob wrestling the Angel in his introduction, the gloves are off in this year's installment of this popular annual anthology. Lehman devotes much of his introduction to throwing jabs at longtime sparring partner and professional poetry grump William Logan, whom Lehman calls &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin skinned.&rdquo; Guest editor Wagoner chooses to abstain from the scuffle, but there's no denying the aesthetic character amassed by the poems he's selected&#58; American poets not only want to talk about their country this year, they want to talk violence in (and toward) their country. &ldquo;They came to blow up America,&rdquo; writes John Ashbery, followed hard on his heels by Mark Bibbins, who warns our fifth state, &ldquo;Connecticut! we're sawing you in half.&rdquo; Denise Duhamel envisions &ldquo;How It Will End&rdquo; (&ldquo;We look around, but no one is watching us&rdquo;) and Rob Cook, in his bold and incantatory &ldquo;Song of America,&rdquo; tells us, &ldquo;I'm raising my child to drown and drop dead and to carry buildings on his back.&rdquo; It appears our poets are at last ready to confront the hysteria and violence of the past eight years, and who can say there's a better year than 2009 to begin.

      "synopsis": "<p><P>\"How ironic,\" Joyce Carol Oates writes in her introduction to this marvelous collection, \"that in our age of rapid mass-production and the easy proliferation of consumer products, the richness and diversity of the American literary imagination should be so misrepresented in most anthologies.\" Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? \"Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?\"<br> In <b>The Oxford Book of American Short Stories</b>, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many \"different, unexpected\" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" and Hemingway's \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's \"Cannibalism in the Cars,\" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (\"That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy\"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,\" of which Oates says, \"Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction.\" From Flannery O'Connor we find \"A Late Encounter With the Enemy,\" and from John Cheever, \"The Death of Justina,\" one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.<br> This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In these lean times, it is difficult to imagine many libraries champing at the bit to purchase yet another anthology of American short stories. But institutions seeking to expand the diversity of their holdings in this area may find this collection the perfect choice. ``Familiar names, unfamiliar titles'' is the raison d'etre for this new volume. Along with some old chestnuts such as ``The Tell-Tale Heart'' and ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,'' editor Oates presents many fresh selections such as Edith Wharton's ``The Journey'' and John Cheever's ``The Death of Justina.'' She includes lesser-known minority and women writers such as Jean Toomer and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman alongside stories by newcomers Amy Tan, Louise Erdrich, and David Leavitt. Each author is given a brief biographical introduction. Recommended for serious literary collections.-- Rita Ciresi, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park</p>",

      "excerpt": "<h1>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</h1>\n<b>Testimonies from Our Imprisoned Sisters</b> \n<hr noshade size=\"1\">\n<b>By Wally Lamb and the Women of the York Correctional Institution</b>  \n<h4 class=\"null1\">HarperCollins Publishers</h4>\n<b>Copyright © 2003</b> <b>Wally Lamb<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n<b>ISBN: 006053429X</b> <br>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n<br>\n<h3>Chapter One</h3>\n<p>Couldn't Keep it to Ourselves</p>\n<p>The toy department at the Durable store sold two blackboards. The modest two-by-three-foot model came with wall brackets and a three-piece starter box of chalk. Its deluxe cousin was framed in wood, had legs and feet, and came \"loaded\": a pair of erasers, a pointer, a twelve-stick chalk set, and a bonus box of colored chalk. I was a third-grader when I spotted that blackboard. Good-bye to Lincoln Logs and Louisville Sluggers. From the age of eight, I wanted to teach.</p>\n<p>My first students were my older sisters. As preteenagers, Gail and Vita were more interested in imitating the dance steps of the American Bandstand \"regulars\" than in playing school, but a direct order from our mother sent them trudging upstairs to my classroom. I'd prepared for their arrival: work sheets, white shirt and clip-on tie, alarm clock hidden under my bed for the surprise fire drill. If my sisters had to play, then they would playact. Vita cast herself as hip-swiveling Cookie Crane, as smoldering a third-grader as there ever was. Gail was Rippy Van Snoot, the class incorrigible. I was launching into opening exercises when Rippy reached past me, grabbed a blackboard eraser, and bounced it off my forehead. Cookie shrieked with delight and lit an imaginary cigarette. I forget which reprobate flung my flash cards into the air and made the room rain arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Fourteen years later I was a high school English teacher with my first actual students. Paula Plunkett and Seth Jinks were the two I remember most vividly from my rookie year. Paula had pretty eyes and graceful penmanship, but she was encased in a fortress of fat. Sad and isolated, she sat at a special table in back because she didn't fit the desks. She never spoke; no one ever spoke to her. In my first-year-teacher naïveté, I sought to draw Paula into the dynamic, thinking group work and class discussion would save her. My plan failed miserably.</p>\n<p>Seth Jinks was in the twelfth-grade class I'd been assigned because I had no seniority. \"The sweathogs,\" these kids dubbed themselves. I was twenty-one, and so were three or four of my sweathogs. We honeymooned for a couple of weeks. Then one morning I walked up the aisle and tapped Seth Jinks on the shoulder. I needed to wake him up so I could exchange the paperback he hadn't read for the new one he wasn't going to read. \"Seth, get your head off the desk,\" I said. \"Here's the new book.\" No response. I poked him. He looked up at me with little-boy-lost eyes. \"Go fuck yourself,\" he said. The room went quiet. The sweathogs, Seth, and I held our collective breath and waited for my response. And in that uneasy silence, and the days, and months, and decades that followed, teaching became for me not just a job but a calling. I have found special meaning in working with hard nuts, tough cookies, and hurtin' buckaroos - those children among us who are the walking wounded.</p>\n<p>That said, I did not want to go to York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's maximum-security prison for women, on that warm August afternoon in 1999. I was keeping a promise I'd made to Marge Cohen, the prison school librarian. Marge had called three months earlier, as I was preparing for a twelve-city book tour in support of my second novel, I Know This Much Is True. Several suicides and suicide attempts had triggered an epidemic of despair at the prison, Marge had explained; the school staff, groping to find help, was canvasing the community. They thought writing might prove useful to the women as a coping tool. Would I come and speak? Because I'm frequently asked to support good causes and have a hard time saying no, I keep an index card taped to my phone - a scripted refusal that allows me to preserve family and writing time. That day, though, I couldn't find my card. I told Marge I'd visit when I got back from my book tour.</p>\n<p>I would never have predicted an author's life for myself, but when I was thirty, while on summer hiatus from teaching, I'd sat down and written a short story on a whim. I liked doing it and wrote another. For my third story, I fused a sarcastic voice to the visual memory of the mute, isolated Paula Plunkett. For years I had worried and wondered about my former student. What had become of her? What had all that weight meant? Who had she been as a child? In the absence of actual knowledge, the life I invented around her remembered image became my first novel, She's Come Undone. It took me nine years to figure out the story of that bruised fictional soul whom I'd fathered and then grown to love and worry over. I loved and stewed over the flawed identical twins of my second novel, too - one of whom had a generous measure of Seth Jinks's anger. What I did not see coming was that the world would embrace these characters also. \"Hello, Wally? Guess what?\" The caller on the other end of the phone line was Oprah Winfrey. She called twice, once for each novel. The result: best-seller lists, limo rides, movie deals, and foreign translations. Oprah's Book Club had taken my life by the seat of the pants and sent me on the road.</p>\n<p>Rock stars on tour bust up their hotel rooms. They get drunk or high, trash the furniture with their bandmates, party with groupies. But authors on tour are quieter, more solitary souls. Between appointments, we sit by ourselves in our rooms, nibbling like prairie dogs on room service sandwiches, or ironing our clothes for the next reading, or watching Judge Judy. Perhaps the most surreal moment during my book tour that summer occurred in a hotel room in Dayton, Ohio. While channel-surfing, I came upon the quiz show Jeopardy! at the exact moment my name surfaced. \"He wrote the novel She's Come Undone,\" Alex Trebek stated. In the long and torturous pause that followed, the three contestants stood there, lockjawed and mute, itching but unable to press their thumbs to their buzzers. And sitting on the edge of the bed in room 417 of the Westin Hotel, I uttered in a sheepish voice, \"Who is Wally Lamb?\"</p>\n<p>I'm a family man, a fiction writer, a teacher, and a guy who can't say no without the index card. On that nervous first drive to York Correctional Institution, I sought to calm myself with music. I was fumbling with CD cases and radio buttons when suddenly, over the airwaves, a piano pounded and the car shook with the vocal thunder of Newark, New Jersey's Abyssinian Baptist Choir. The unfamiliar song so overpowered me that I pulled to the shoulder to listen. When it ended, I looked up at the highway sign in front of which I'd landed. correctional facility area, it said. do not stop. The inexplicable emotional wallop of that moment fills me with wonder to this day.</p>\n<p>To gain access to the women of York prison, you check in with the guard at the main gate, hang your laminated badge on your shirt pocket, walk through a metal detector, then pass through a series of ten doors, some of which slide open mysteriously after you stand and wait. You don't see who's flipping the switches, so it's an Orwellian entrance. At the prison school, I met my liaison, Dale Griffith, a warm and exuberant English teacher. Dale and I arranged the chairs in a circle, a uniformed corrections officer bellowed orders from the corridor, and thirty inmates entered the room.</p>\n<p>Dressed identically in cranberry T-shirts and pocketless jeans, the women came in all colors, shapes, sizes, and degrees of gender identification. Their attitudes ranged from hangdog to Queen of Sheba. Most had shown up not to write but to check out \"that guy who was on Oprah.\" I spoke. We tried some exercises. I asked if anyone had questions about writing. Several hands shot into the air. \"You met Oprah?\" \"What's Oprah like?\" \"Oprah's cool, you know what I'm sayin'?\" Uh, was that a question?</p>\n<p>At the end of my talk, one of the women stood, thanked me for coming, and pitched me a curveball. \"You coming back?\" she asked. Thirty pairs of wary eyes were upon me and my index card was back in my office. \"Uh, well . . . okay,\" I said. \"Write something and I'll see you in two weeks. Any subject, two pages minimum. Your drafts will be your tickets into the workshop.\"</p>\n<p>At session two, fifteen of the thirty chairs were empty. Stacie wanted praise, not feedback. Manhattan said she'd meant to be vague and nonspecific - that her business wasn't necessarily the reader's business. Ruth must have thought she was a guest on Oprah; she'd written only a paragraph, but man oh man, did she want to talk. At age fifty-five Diane was the senior member of the group. For ninety minutes she hunched forward, fists clenched on her desktop. Her suspicious eyes followed my every move. Diane had written under the pseudonym Natasha and had exacted a promise before class that her work would never, ever be read aloud. I predicted she'd be gone by session three.</p>\n<p>But it was during session three that Diane Bartholomew (\"Snapshots of My Early Life\") couldn't keep her writing to herself. Her shaky hand went up and she asked if she could share what she'd written. In a barely audible voice, she read a disjointed, two-page summary of her horrific life story: incest, savage abuse, spousal homicide, lawyerly indifference, and, in prison, parallel battles against breast cancer and deep, dark depression. When she stopped, there was silence, a communal intake of breath. Then, applause - a single pair of hands at first, joined by another pair, and then by everyone. Bartholomew had sledgehammered the dam of distrust, and the women's writing began to flow.</p>\n<p>That was three years ago. I stopped counting sessions somewhere around number fifty. Writers have come and gone: the narcotics-addicted nurse who wrote a moving apologia to a deceased aunt whose support had never wavered; the high school athlete who, a month after graduation, brandished her softball bat during a convenience store robbery and wrote to figure out why; the young alcoholic mother who time-traveled, penning a personal letter to one of the prison's original 1917 inmates, also an alcoholic. The workshop sessions have been a journey rich with laughter, tears, heart-stopping leaps of faith, and miraculous personal victories. There have been bumps in the road, too. Addicts are elusive; they tend to begin promising drafts, take them to some interesting midway point, then give up on themselves and stop coming. There have been trust issues. Prison is not a place where trust is given easily, and a writer who shares her work in progress risks exposure. That risk taking must be honored. Only the writer should decide when, and if, her work is ready for the eyes and ears of nongroup members - ready, in other words, to go public. If another group member breaches that trust, she has to leave. Similarly, a few con artists and drama queens have been handed their walking papers. A functional writing community cannot accommodate the needs of would-be superstars or instigators of the guess-what-she-said-about-you variety. But those have been the exceptions. The brave writers whose work is represented in this volume have acted in good faith, faced their demons, stayed the course, and revised relentlessly. And in taking on the subject of themselves - making themselves vulnerable to the unseen reader - they have exchanged powerlessness for the power that comes with self-awareness.</p>\n<p>\"I started writing because of a terrible feeling of powerlessness,\" the novelist Anita Brookner has said. The National Book Award winner Alice McDermott noted that the most difficult thing about becoming a writer was convincing herself that she had anything to say that people would want to read. \"There's nothing to writing,\" the columnist Red Smith once commented. \"All you do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein.\"</p>\n<p>Michelle Jessamy (\"Motherlove\") was fourteen when she became pregnant by her teenage boyfriend. Despite the challenges, Jessamy's impending motherhood helped her get closer to her own emotionally distant mother. As she drafted her memory piece, that mother-daughter epiphany emerged as the centerpiece. Then, mid-draft, Jessamy hit a snag. She began writing a flashback to an earlier instance of sexual abuse - a hallway molestation by a friend of the family when she was eleven. The painful incident was integral to the story she needed to tell, but disclosing her long-kept secret made Jessamy feel uncomfortable. She stopped writing. But self-censorship felt uncomfortable, too. Jessamy had worked hard on her essay and wanted to see it through. The solution? A change of genre. On paper, Jessamy became Mo'Shay Shambly, and the pronoun I became she. Mo'Shay had the same hazel eyes as Michelle, the same experiences. But now Jessamy was writing autobiographical fiction. That little bit of distance unblocked her and she finished her piece.</p>\n<p>Brenda Medina (\"Hell, and How I Got Here\") was self-censoring like Michelle Jessamy, but for a very different reason. For months after she joined our group, she labored on the same short essay about the death of her uncle Carlos - draft after draft after draft. One day I suggested to Medina that, God bless him, I didn't think I had the strength to attend to poor Uncle Carlos's death one more time. \"There's something else I want to write about, but I can't,\" she told me. That \"something\" was what had landed her in prison ten years earlier at age seventeen: her affiliation with a violent street gang.</p>\n<p>York Correctional Institution is vigilant in its efforts to eliminate gang influence within the compound. Incarcerated gang members who choose to uphold their allegiance to \"the family\" pay a steep price in the form of punitive segregation, loss of privileges, and loss of the \"good time\" that can shorten their stay on the inside. A self-described punk when she arrived at York, Brenda Medina had traveled a long and difficult road as an inmate, freeing herself from the psychological grip of her \"family\" and undertaking the rigorous step-by-step process by which an inmate repudiates her gang affiliation and begins rehabilitation in earnest. Even mentioning the name of a gang can cast suspicion that the inmate has reneged on her disaffiliation. Medina's very real fear was that, if she wrote about her past life, her work might be seized, taken out of context, and misconstrued as gang-friendly. If that happened, she could lose much of what she had worked so hard to achieve. My collaborator, Dale Griffith, dealt with the problem directly. She sought and received permission from prison officials for Medina to take up her gang experience as subject matter. With that hurdle cleared, the writer was on her way to a personal essay that, far from glorifying gangs, depicts their insidious hold on young people's lives and the cancerous destruction of their futures.</p>\n<p>In her much-loved book on writing, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, Anne Lamott observes: \"We write to expose the unexposed.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n Excerpted from <b>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</b> by <b>Wally Lamb and the Women of the York Correctional Institution</b> Copyright © 2003 by Wally Lamb<br>\n Excerpted by permission.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Wally Lamb's novels <i>She's Come Undone</i> and <i>I Know This Much Is True</i> were both Oprah's Book Club selections and No. 1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. On the surface, <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> is far different than these works of fiction. In this heart-wrenching collection, Lamb introduces and presents 11 female writers who happen to be convicted felons. Their pieces, as potent as their personalities, would be less accessible without Lamb's modest and disarming preludes. \"Prison,\" he writes, \"is not a place where trust is given easily.\" Obviously, he earned that trust, and we now share its fruits.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>The Los Angeles Times</h4>One truth this book affirms is the capacity for people to change. The writers of <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i> chart their own journeys of growth, navigating the terrain of their internal worlds, their pasts and present prison realities. Who they have become is clear both in self-awareness and what they do with their lives — teaching others, advocacy, computer work, construction in prison and out. It is in this change that hope resides; lying next to and rising out of despair, hope permeates the book. Why, in the end, does Lamb want us to care about 10 women in prison? Perhaps because in noticing the humanity of others, we become more human ourselves. — <i>Kathy Boudin</i>\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Bestselling author and Oprah Winfrey favorite Lamb (She's Come Undone; I Know This Much Is True) takes a cue from Winfrey herself in collecting and editing this book of writings gleaned from a workshop he conducted for the female inmates of Connecticut's York Correctional Institution. The result is an intriguing and powerful collection of unlikely literary debuts. Although the 11 selections cover the range one might expect from writings plucked from a women's prison-tales of broken homes, poverty, violence, teenage pregnancy, race and gender bias, and, of course, crime and punishment-Lamb succeeds in giving the collection an intense, recognizable emotional core reminiscent of his blockbuster debut novel, She's Come Undone. Indeed, each selection bears the marks of Lamb's heavy involvement-the clipped yet elegant prose and the delicate, occasionally humorous manner in which difficult emotional situations are rendered. Standout selections include Nancy Whiteley's opening remembrance of her troubled adolescence and Diane Bartholomew's artfully rendered, heart-wrenching \"Snapshots of My Early Life.\" As a sad footnote, Bartholomew, whom Lamb credits with inspiring the success of the workshop, will never see her opus in print. Sent to prison in 1990 for murdering her abusive husband, Bartholomew was stricken with cancer while serving her sentence and died in November 2001. In his introduction, Lamb calls the workshop \"a journey rich with laughter, tears, [and] heart-stopping leaps of faith.\" To the credit of Lamb and his authors, this book, the end product of the workshop, is as well. (On sale Feb. 1) Forecast: Although this book is a departure for Lamb, fans of She's Come Undone will undoubtedly enjoy it. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>At the urgent request of the librarian at York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, Lamb (She's Come Undone) organized a writing class for incarcerated women. The intention was to make writing a coping tool that might counter an epidemic of despair at the prison. The 12 pieces in this volume are the best of the students' efforts, and as efforts they are noteworthy, offering memoirs of childhood and acute observations about prison life. In \"Three Steps Past the Monkeys,\" Nancy Birkla chronicles her dependence on drugs by describing her early dependence on candy. In \"Christmas in Prison,\" Robin Cullen describes a congregation at a prison church service as \"a rainbow of skin tones, their chocolate, honey vanilla, and raspberry ripple-colored hair topped with crocheted red scrunchies that sit like cherries atop ice cream parlor hairdos.\" All in all, the volume represents good student writing and a success from everyone's point of view. If it is vying for shelf space with professional writers, it will probably (and justifiably) lose out. But if funds permit, it is worth considering.-Frances Sandiford, formerly with Green Haven Correctional Facility Lib., Stormville, NY Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Intense attestations of lives that ran afoul of the law, from women who have done or are doing time at a prison in Connecticut. Bestselling novelist Lamb (I Know This Much Is True, 1998, etc.) teaches a course in writing at the York Correctional Institution, and he offers here a selection of ten works from the women in his class, plus one by his co-instructor. The pieces are uniformly wrenching, reported from desperate circumstances by authors doomed to punishment. Yet they are as far from self-pity as possible, written by extremely self-aware authors who give a clear sense of setting out to take some degree of control of their destinies. Each piece is a probing re-examination of its author’s life and of the reasons she ended up in prison. Some recount childhoods taxing by any yardstick, years of learning to become \"experts at detecting the slightest barometric fluctuations of Storm Mom,\" or of being raped by a father who’d just lost the house in a card game—and, at term, having the baby spirited away before its mother was allowed to touch him. There are demons aplenty, inner ones begging to be tamed by drugs, and outer ones, like husbands, uncontrollable (one woman asks, \"Why do I feel safer here in prison than I felt at home?\"). The maximum-security prison is a tough house, and prospects of release for some of the writers are dim: \"Ineligible for parole, I have served the first nine years of my twenty-five year sentence. I am 27.\" This same person will also say, \"I’m kept afloat by my writing.\" And her writing, like other of the women’s, is lean, with the momentum and clarity needed for its work of helping frame and make sense of these authors’ situations. There are things, says Lamb,that need \"to be known about prison and prisoners. There are misconceptions to be abandoned, biases to be dropped.\" Here’s a step in that direction.\n\n</article>"

      "excerpt": "<p class=\"null1\">FOREWORD</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">by David Lehman</p>\n<p>Over the years I’ve read novels centering on lawyers, doctors, diplomats, teachers, financiers, even car salesmen and dentists, but not until 2009 did I come across one about the travails of the editor of a poetry anthology. When word of <i>The Anthologist</i>, Nicholson Baker’s new novel, reached me last September, I couldn’t wait to read it. Baker’s novels defy convention and reveal an obsessive nature, and I wondered what he would make of American poetry, for surely his novel would reflect a strenuous engagement with the art. The title character here, Paul Chowder by unfortunate name, has put together an anthology of poems he is calling <i>Only Rhyme.</i> The phrase describes the notional book’s contents and indicates the editor’s conception of poetic virtue. Paul has chosen the contents of his anthology but is now, on the eve of a deadline, afflicted with writer’s block. He needs to write a foreword but cannot. “How many people read introductions to poetry anthologies, anyway?” he wonders, then volunteers, “I do, but I’m not normal.”</p>\n<p>Having asked myself that same question and given a similar answer, I can appreciate the speaker’s troubling awareness of the many poets who have to be left out of his book—and the relatively few people who will bother to read his introductory essay. The task of writing a prefatory note becomes no less difficult when it is an annual requirement, though Nicholson Baker may have made my job a little easier this time around. Every editor has the impulse to use the introductory space to open the door, welcome the guest, and disappear without further ado. But some things are worth saying, and one such is Baker’s defense of anthologies. For a poet facing all the perils that lurk in a poet’s path—a poet very like the novel’s Paul Chowder—anthologies represent the possibility of a belated second chance. And it is that possibility, however slim, that spurs the poet to stick to a vocation that offers so much resistance and promises so few rewards. The “you” in these sentences refers to the American poet—and perhaps to American poetry itself, an oddity in an age that worships celebrity. “You think: One more poem. You think: There will be some as yet ungathered anthology of American poetry. It will be the anthology that people tote around with them on subways thirty-five, forty years from now.” The poet’s conception of fame exists within modest limits, but it is persistent: “And you think: Maybe the very poem I write today will somehow pry open a space in that future anthology and maybe it will drop into position and root itself there.”</p>\n<p>Baker’s skeptical distance from the fray makes his take on things particularly compelling. The opinions he puts forth are provocative and entertaining. A proponent of the sit-com as the great American art form, Baker’s anthologist believes that “any random episode of <i>Friends</i> is probably better, more uplifting for the human spirit, than ninety-nine percent of the poetry or drama or fiction or history ever published.” That is quite a statement, even allowing for the complexity of irony. (After all, to be “uplifting for the human spirit” may not be the ideal criterion by which to judge poetry or history.) The speaker establishes his credentials as an American poet with his realism for self-pity’s sake. He suspects that poets form a “community” only in the realm of piety: “We all love the busy ferment, and we all know it’s nonsense. Getting together for conferences of international poetry. Hah! A joke. Reading our poems. Our little moment. Physical presence. In the same room with. A community. Forget it. It’s a joke.”</p>\n<p>Baker (or his mouthpiece) likes Swinburne, Poe, Millay, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, and the contemporary British poets Wendy Cope and James Fenton. He disapproves of free verse, distrusts the “ultra-extreme enjambment” that you find in William Carlos Williams or Charles Olson, and argues that “iambic pentameter” is something of a hoax. As for the unrhymed poems that dominate literary magazines and university workshops, he feels it would be more accurate to call them “plums” and their authors “plummets” or “plummers.” How did we get to this state of affairs? In Baker’s account, the chief villain is Ezra Pound, “a blustering bigot—a humorless jokester—a talentless pasticheur—a confidence man.” Pound advocated modernism in verse with the same bullying arrogance that went into his radio broadcasts on behalf of Mussolini, and that is no accident, because the impulse that led to fascism also gave rise to modern poetry. Modernism as Pound preached it and T. S. Eliot practiced it—in <i>The Waste Land</i>, “a hodge-podge of flummery and borrowed paste”—was, in short, probably as ruinous for the art of verse as fascism was for Europe. The popularity of translations, especially prose versions of exotic foreign verse rendered from a language that the translator doesn’t know, also did its part to hasten the “death of rhyme.”</p>\n<p>The views articulated in <i>The Anthologist</i> are antithetical to contemporary practice in ways that recall Philip Larkin’s conviction that Pound ruined poetry, Picasso ruined painting, and Charlie Parker ruined jazz: the dissenting position, pushed to an amusing extreme, and stated with uncompromising intelligence. The narrator can sound a sour note. To teach creative writing to college students is to be “a professional teller of lies,” he maintains, gleefully quoting Elizabeth Bishop on the subject: “I think one of the worst things I know about modern education is this ‘Creative Writing’ business.” Nevertheless Baker’s opinions are worth pondering, especially when the “difficulty versus accessibility” question becomes the subject of debate. And his advice to the aspiring poet is astute. Don’t postpone writing the poem, he says. “Put it down, work on it, finish it. If you don’t get on it now, somebody else will do something similar, and when you crack open next year’s <i>Best American Poetry</i> and see it under somebody else’s name you’ll hate yourself.”</p>\n<p><i>The Anthologist</i> was well received and prominently reviewed in book supplements that rarely notice poetry books, let alone anthologies of them, except with a certain contempt, which was a mild irony but an old story. Some laudatory articles went so far as to declare that “you” will enjoy the work “even if you generally couldn’t care less about verse.” But then, when poetry or the teaching of poetry is discussed, commentators have a hard time avoiding a note of condescension. Poetry is called a “lost art.” It is thought to be something young people go through, a phase; something you have to apologize for, as when a poet at a reading reassures the audience that only three more poems remain on the docket. And yet poetry retains its prestige. The term exists as a sort of benchmark in fields ranging from politics to athletics. Columnists enjoy reminding newly elected officials that “you campaign in poetry but govern in prose”—an axiom that aligns poetry on the side of idealism and eloquence against the bureaucratic details and inconveniences of prosaic administration. In the <i>Financial Times</i>, the Czech photographer Miroslav Tichý, who spied on women with his homemade viewfinder, “stealing their likenesses as they giggled, gossiped and dreamed,” is described as “a peeping Tom with a poet’s eye.” Of Nancy Pelosi, readers of <i>Time</i> learned that, to the Speaker’s credit, when a colleague’s mother dies, she “encloses a poem written by her own mother with her condolence.” In the same issue of the magazine, a flattering profile of General Stanley McChrystal, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, appeared. During the Iraq war, McChrystal sent copies of “The Second Coming” to his special operators, challenging them to flip the meaning of Yeats’s lines: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.”</p>\n<p>Has there ever been a really good movie about a poet as opposed to the many excellent movies in which poetry is quoted to smart effect? <i>Bright Star</i>, Jane Campion’s film about the ill-starred romance of John Keats and the barely legal Fanny Brawne, came out in 2009 and showed there is life left in the familiar stereotype of the consumptive poet burning a fever for love. Campion won over Quentin Tarantino. “The movie made me think about taking a writing class,” the director of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> said. “One of the best things that can happen from a movie about an author is that you actually want to read their work.” On television, poetry continues to put in regular appearances on <i>The PBS NewsHour</i> with Jim Lehrer and sometimes sneaks into scripted shows. When an advertising copywriter on <i>Mad Men</i> loses his job, he doesn’t take it well. He “did not go gentle into that good night,” an ex-associate observes. The critic Stephen Burt believes that <i>Project Runway</i> holds some useful lessons for poetry critics: “<i>Project Runway</i> even recalls the famous exercises in ‘practical criticism’ performed at the University of Cambridge in the 1920s, in which professor I. A. Richards asked his students to make snap judgments about unfamiliar poems.” I have commented on the inspired way that quotations from poems turn up in classic Hollywood movies, and if you’re lucky enough to catch <i>It’s Always Fair Weather</i> the next time Robert Osborne shows it on TCM, you’ll see a superb 1950s movie musical (music by André Previn, book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green) that sums itself up brilliantly in three lines from <i>As You Like It</i> that enliven a conversation between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse:</p>\n<p>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</p>\n<p>Then heigh-ho, the holly!</p>\n<p>This life is most jolly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can’t pull the wool over the creative writers responsible for <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent.</i> In a 2009 episode, a celebrated campus bard is murdered by his ex-girlfriend, who is handy with a knife. Has he been pimping out his attractive young assistants to wealthy donors? After learning how rotten the poets are to one another, the major case squad detective says that if her daughter ever says she wants to be a poet, she’d tell her to join the Mafia instead: “Nicer people.” As convalescents confined to hospital beds know, you can go wall to wall with reruns of <i>Law and Order</i>, and sure enough, the day after this episode aired I saw a rerun of <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</i>, in which the villain is a nerdy insurance man, an actuary with Asperger’s syndrome, whose name is Wallace Stevens. The detectives call him Wally affectionately. I spent the rest of my bedridden day with Stevens’s collected poems.</p>\n<p><i>Haaretz</i>, Israel’s oldest Hebrew-language daily, turned over its pages entirely to poets and novelists for one day in June 2009. The results were unsurprising in some ways (a lot of first-person point of view) but inventive and unconventional in the coverage of the stock market (“everything okay”) and the weather (a sonnet likening summer to an unsharpened pencil). The experiment reminded me of W. S. Di Piero’s assertion that the writing of good prose is the acid test of a poet’s intelligence. “Some shy from putting prose out there because it’s a giveaway,” Di Piero has written. “You can’t fake it. It reveals quality of mind, for better or worse, in a culture where poems can be faked. Find a faker and ask him or her to write anything more substantial than a jacket blurb, and the jig is up.” When we posted Di Piero’s remark on the <i>Best American Poetry</i> blog, Sally Ashton added an apt simile (a poem can be faked “like an orgasm”) and a few inevitable questions (“Who is fooled? Who benefits?”). Speaking of the <i>BAP</i> blog, there are days when it resembles nothing so much as a cross-cultural newspaper written by poets and poetry lovers. Recent visitors to the <i>BAP</i> blog could read Catharine Stimpson’s reaction to homicidal violence at the University of Alabama; Lewis Saul’s meticulously annotated commentary on thirty films by Akira Kurosawa; Jennifer Michael Hecht’s heartfelt plea to poets contemplating the suicide of Rachel Wetzsteon (“don’t kill yourself”); Laura Orem’s obituaries for Lucille Clifton, Jean Simmons, and J. D. Salinger; Katha Pollitt on Berlin in the fall; Larry Epstein on Bob Dylan; Ken Tucker on new books of poetry; Todd Swift on young British poets; Phoebe Putnam on the covers poets choose for their books; Mitch Sisskind’s “poetic tips of the day” (e.g., “Secrecy sustains the world”); Gabrielle Calvocoressi at the sports desk; Terence Winch on Irish American music; Stacey Harwood on <i>nocino</i>, the Italian liqueur made from under-ripe green walnuts; and a James Cummins epigram entitled “Anti-Confessional”: “What it was like, I don’t recall, or care to; / believe me, you should be grateful I spare you.”</p>\n<p><i>The Best American Poetry</i> anthology itself, now in its twenty-third year, remains committed to the idea that American poetry is as vital as it is various and that it is possible to capture the spirit of its diversity and a measure of its excellence in an annual survey of our magazines, in print or online. As the selections are made by a different editor each year, each a distinguished practitioner, the series has inevitably become an annotated chronicle of the taste of our leading poets. I persuaded Amy Gerstler to make the selections for the 2010 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i> because of my delight in her poems and my respect for her judgment, and it was wonderful to work with her. Amy’s new book, <i>Dearest Creature</i>, came out last year, and augmented her reputation as arguably the most inventive and ambitious poet of her generation. Gerstler can be very funny without forfeiting her right to be taken seriously; she has a quality of sincerity, of truth-telling, that can coexist with the most sophisticated of comic sensibilities. Her poems of deep feeling may take on an insouciant disguise: a letter to a cherished niece about the virtues of an encyclopedia, a conversation between a black taffeta and strapless pink dress, a riff consisting entirely of slang phrases from the not too distant past. Yet always at the heart of the poetry is an insight into the human condition and the ability to state it simply and powerfully: “Some of us grow up doing / credible impressions of model citizens / (though sooner or later hairline / cracks appear in our facades). The rest / get dubbed eccentrics, unnerved and undone / by other people’s company, for which we / nevertheless pine.” David Kirby reviewed <i>Dearest Creature</i> in <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> “Gerstler is skilled in every kind of comedy, from slapstick to whimsy,” Kirby wrote. “Yet there’s a deep seriousness in every one of these poems, like the plaintive ‘Midlife Lullaby,’ in which the cow who is now the meatloaf in somebody’s sandwich speaks of life’s passing pleasures as hauntingly as one of those skeletons who tend to pop up in medieval allegories to remind young knights of their mortality.” Kirby concluded his review with a ringing endorsement: “In Amy Gerstler I trust.”</p>\n<p>The world has been slow to react to the case of Saw Wai, the imprisoned Burmese poet who was arrested two years ago for publishing a love poem for Valentine’s Day with a secret message critical of Burma’s military dictator, Than Shwe. But the story refuses to die, and the anonymously translated poem itself has now been published (in <i>Pen America</i>) and reprinted (in <i>Harper’s</i>, in February 2010). What early journalistic accounts called a “straightforward” or “innocuous” love poem turns out to be something much richer and stranger. Entitled “February 14,” Saw Wai’s poem, which appeared in the Rangoon magazine <i>The Love Journal</i>, was initially said to have been a torch song to the fashion model who rejected the poet but taught him the meaning of love. Nothing of the sort. It exemplifies rather a particular strain of modernist poetry, the leading-edge poems of the 1930s that were aped (and perfected) by the Australian hoax poet Ern Malley. The poem is an acrostic—that is, the first letters of the lines, when read down vertically, spell out a message, and in this case that message is, “General Than Shwe is power crazy.” In Burmese, Than means “million” and Shwe means “gold,” so when Saw Wai concludes his poem with the injunction “Millions of people / Who know how to love / Please clap your gilded hands / And laugh out loud,” he is secretly urging his compatriots to laugh the “power crazy” head of the junta off the stage. It took courage to write these lines. It also took an extraordinary talent for modern poetry considered as a kind of cipher, and the result in its English translation might be read as either a brief for the methods of modernism or a textbook illustration of what Nicholson Baker would have us see as the tempting dangers of the non-rhyming, prose-saturated “plum”:</p>\n<p>Arensberg said:<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Only once you have experienced deep pain</p>\n<p>And madness</p>\n<p>And like an adolescent</p>\n<p>Thought the blurred photo of a model</p>\n<p>Great art</p>\n<p>Can you call it heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Millions of people</p>\n<p>Who know how to love</p>\n<p>Please clap your gilded hands</p>\n<p>And laugh out loud.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>. Walter Conrad Arensberg, the noted art collector and donor of great paintings to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, wrote <i>The Cryptography of Shakespeare</i> (1922), purporting to find, in the Bard’s plays, anagrams and acrostics that prove Francis Bacon’s authorship. Arensberg wrote symbolist-influenced poetry, but it is conceivable that spurious cryptography is his real contribution to the radical element in modern poetry.</p>\n<p>© 2010 David Lehman</p>",

Lauren Slater is a therapist in the institution where she was once a patient. John Edgar Wideman reacts passionately to the unjust murder of Emmett Till. Charles Simic tells of wild nights with Uncle Boris. John McPhee creates a rare, personal, album quilt. Terry Tempest Williams speaks on the decline of the prairie dog. Madison Smartt Bell invades Haiti. Many of the writers are crossing genres—from poetry and fiction to nonfiction—symbolic of <b>Creative Nonfiction's</b> scope and popularity. A cross section of the famous and those bound to become so, this collection is a riveting experience highlighting the expanding importance of this dramatic and exciting new genre.</p>",

Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br>\n From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, “into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we’ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.” Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.</p>",
      "excerpt": "Foreword<br>\nThe Essay in the Twentieth Century<br>\nWhen I was very young, my father purchased a small, uniform set of <br>\ncheap literary classics. Why, I never knew. He was not a reader. <br>\nPerhaps he had been duped by a door-to-door salesman. Perhaps he had <br>\naspirations for his children. The books crowded the only bookshelf in <br>\na cramped two-family house hedged in by humming factories on a narrow <br>\nstreet that dead-ended into the mysterious and spectacular sumac-<br>\nlined banks of the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. As a result <br>\nof his once-in-a-lifetime purchase I grew up with the privilege of <br>\nknowing that Emerson was not merely the name of a television set.<br>\n<br>\nI found Emerson's message bracing and liberating. I can see <br>\nit now as self-help elevated to the highest literary standard, but <br>\nreading \"Self-Reliance\" as an adolescent I simply took heart from his <br>\nexhortations to resist conformity, trust in oneself, and not feel <br>\npressured by conventions, parties, and authority: \"I am ashamed to <br>\nthink how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large <br>\nsocieties and dead institutions,\" he said. \"If I know your sect, I <br>\nanticipate your argument,\" he said. \"Insist on yourself; never <br>\nimitate,\" he said. He warned about the physical pain of forced smiles <br>\nand acknowledged the advantages of being misunderstood. If the <br>\nwritings of the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides comprised a <br>\nGuide for the Perplexed, Emerson's essays provided a Guide for the <br>\nIntimidated. His independent, freethinking, inquisitive mind shaped <br>\nAmerican thought and writing, and his spiritual heirsinvented the <br>\ntwentieth-century essay.<br>\nAlthough Emerson may be said to hover over the volume, his <br>\npresence can be detected more directly in one of his most prominent <br>\ndescendants, William James. Although this selection of great American <br>\nessays begins in 1901, one could argue that the symbolic origins of <br>\nthe twentieth-century essay go back to the day in 1842 when Emerson <br>\nwas invited by the James family to visit their New York apartment <br>\nand \"bless\" young William in his cradle. As a teacher, lecturer, <br>\nphysician, scientist, and one of the founders of modern psychology, <br>\nWilliam James would exert a powerful influence over the new century. <br>\nTwo of his students, W.E.B. Du Bois and Gertrude Stein, would <br>\npermanently alter the course of the American essay by initiating two <br>\nnew modes of literary introspection: Du Bois's \"double-consciousness\" <br>\ngrounded in racial identity and Stein's experiments with \"stream of <br>\nconsciousness.\" Both originated in the critical first decade of the <br>\ncentury, and their literary legacies can be felt throughout this <br>\ncollection.<br>\nThe twentieth-century essay also emerged from a resistance to <br>\nthe \"familiar\" or \"polite\" essay that had been a literary staple of <br>\nthe preceding era. Proper, congenial, Anglophilic, the genteel essay <br>\nsurvived, even against the skepticism and irascibility of the Mark <br>\nTwains, Randolph Bournes, and H. L. Menckens, who did their best to <br>\nbury it. By the 1930s, however, some writers were lamenting its <br>\ndemise, and in the most curious metaphors. \"The familiar essay, that <br>\nlavender-scented little old lady of literature, has passed away,\" one <br>\nwrote, regretting that magazines now filled their pages with \"crisp <br>\narticles, blatant exposés, or statistic-laden surveys,\" and <br>\nconcluding that one day \"her pale ghost will not appear at all, and <br>\nthe hard young sociologists can have her pages all to themselves.\" <br>\nBut the \"pale ghost\" did not vanish all at once. It lived on in <br>\ncollege courses and gave the essay a bad name for decades. The goal <br>\nof English teachers, the novelist Kurt Vonnegut recalls, was to get <br>\nyou \"to write like cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago.\"<br>\nThis collection features none of those \"lavender-scented\" <br>\nessays, not even for historical reasons. Our object was not to <br>\nconstruct a Museum of the American Essay. Although some vestiges <br>\nof \"gentility\" or essayistic \"leisure\" may have seeped in here and <br>\nthere, the ruling idea behind the volume was that the essays should <br>\nspeak to the present, not merely represent the past. So you will find <br>\nmore \"hard young sociologists\" here than \"cultivated\" literati. After <br>\nall, some of those young social scientists were Jane Addams, Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston, and a youthful Saul Bellow, who happened to be <br>\nstudying sociology and anthropology at Northwestern at precisely the <br>\nsame time the genteel essayists were lamenting their own demise. The <br>\nsociologists, accompanied by such self-taught social critics as <br>\nEdmund Wilson, Richard Wright, and James Agee, brought the essay out <br>\nof the library and into the American factories, city streets, <br>\ncourthouses, and tenant farms. For many of them, ardent pacifists and <br>\nreformers, writing essays would amount to what James called \"the <br>\nmoral equivalent of war.\"<br>\nUnlike their predecessors, twentieth-century essayists were <br>\neager to confront inner as well as outer strife. To be sure, the <br>\ngenteel essay was personal, but no matter how \"familiar,\" it always <br>\npolitely stopped short of full disclosure. Here, too, William James <br>\nmade his presence felt. The brilliant chapters \"The Divided Self\" <br>\nand \"The Sick Soul\" in his monumental The Varieties of Religious <br>\nExperience (1902) would become a valuable resource for essayists <br>\nseeking ways to articulate despair, breakdowns, aberrant states of <br>\nconsciousness, psychic confusion, the ineffable in general. F. Scott <br>\nFitzgerald's famous observation in \"The Crack-Up\" - \"The test of a <br>\nfirst-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in <br>\nthe mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function\" -<br>\n laid out a course for future essayists and expanded the <br>\npossibilities of self-disclosure. As writers began amplifying the <br>\npersonal essay into what is now known singularly as \"the memoir,\" the <br>\nprocesses of confession would know no limits.<br>\nWhat next? Will this new century reject our \"best\" essays as <br>\ndramatically as the twentieth discarded those of James Russell Lowell <br>\nand Oliver Wendell Holmes? The 1890s, too, saw astonishing changes in <br>\ntechnology, rapid changes that frightened Henry Adams as he wondered <br>\nwhat the \"Law of Acceleration\" would finally lead to. We have reached <br>\nhis speculative end point - visionary though he was, he never <br>\nimagined a world transformed by electronics. The Internet is already <br>\ngenerating new sources of essays. Will it somehow channel the usual <br>\nprocesses of prose into new literary forms the way some thought the <br>\ntypewriter had once done? Will young essayists discover audiences <br>\nwithout having to sweat through the hundreds of rejection slips James <br>\nThurber received before he could break into print? And will they do <br>\nwhat few from any century have ever done: make a living writing <br>\nessays? These remain to be seen, but what I think we can say for <br>\ncertain is that whatever new forms the essay takes, if they are <br>\nwonderful, they will have the blessing of William James and his <br>\nlegitimate heirs.<br>\n<br>\nAbout This Collection<br>\nThis volume is not a \"best of the best.\" I founded The Best American <br>\nEssays series in 1986, and therefore Joyce Carol Oates and I had only <br>\na small slice of the century to provide us with essays that had <br>\nalready achieved an annual \"best\" status. Only seven of the essays in <br>\nthis volume come from the series. We wish we could have included many <br>\nmore of the superb contemporary writers who have contributed to the <br>\nyearly books, but it was of course not possible. Our consolation is <br>\nthat their work is still accessible to readers and that the annual <br>\nbooks are for the most part available in libraries and bookstores. It <br>\nwas important that we include writers from previous generations who <br>\nmay not be well known to today's readers and who in our opinion still <br>\nvery much deserve an audience.<br>\nI proceeded with this book in much the same way that I have <br>\nwith the annual volumes. I screened a good number of essays - though <br>\nfar, far more than usual - and turned them over to Joyce Carol Oates <br>\nfor a final decision. There were hundreds of essays to consider and <br>\nso little space. But we winnowed and winnowed and arrived at these <br>\nfifty-five. We tried to include the best of as many different kinds <br>\nof essay as possible - personal, critical, philosophical, humorous, <br>\npastoral, autobiographical, scientific, documentary, political. <br>\nObviously we had to pull back in many cases. A comparable volume <br>\ncould be assembled to showcase each one of these categories. I also <br>\nexercised one final choice: I insisted that Oates's essay from The <br>\nBest American Essays 1996, \"They All Just Went Away,\" be included.<br>\n \"Essays end up in books,\" Susan Sontag writes, \"but they <br>\nstart their lives in magazines.\" That fact may not interest many <br>\nreaders, but it played a large role in the research for this book, <br>\nsince between an essay's debut in a periodical and its inclusion in a <br>\ncollection, a good deal of revision often occurs. Vladimir Nabokov's <br>\nmemoir of his father, for example, went through three very distinct <br>\npublishing stages. It began life as \"The Perfect Past\" in The New <br>\nYorker in 1950, but Nabokov, dissatisfied with some of the editing, <br>\nreturned to his original typescript when he included (and expanded) <br>\nit as the opening chapter of his 1951 autobiography, Conclusive <br>\nEvidence. When he revised that book as Speak, Memory: An <br>\nAutobiography Revisited in 1966, he expanded the essay yet again. Of <br>\nthe three published versions, we chose - as we did with many of the <br>\nselections - to reprint the final version, as it would reflect and <br>\nrespect the author's final decisions. But in some instances <br>\n(consistency \"is the hobgoblin of little minds,\" Emerson said), we <br>\nselected the first or a different published version.<br>\nSome essays start out looking like essays only to reemerge in <br>\nunexpected contexts. James Agee's lovely childhood <br>\nreminiscence, \"Knoxville: Summer of 1915,\" started out in Partisan <br>\nReview in 1938 but was given a new twist when an editor cleverly <br>\nborrowed and italicized it in 1957 to serve as the introduction to <br>\nAgee's posthumously published novel, A Death in the Family. Other <br>\nessays in this book were also put to service by their authors to <br>\nintroduce works of fiction: Richard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living <br>\nJim Crow\" became the preface to his collection of stories Uncle Tom's <br>\nChildren, and N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain\" now <br>\nserves as the prologue to his popular novel of the same title.<br>\nI discovered that there is rarely only one version of an <br>\nessay. Susan Sontag's useful observation sometimes gets reversed: an <br>\nessay starts out in book form and ends up in a magazine. Several <br>\nessays in this volume were skillfully carved out of books and re-<br>\ncreated either by their authors or a magazine's editors as <br>\nindependent essays. Usually, what's required is the removal of the <br>\ninterstitial glue that connects a book's separate chapters. For <br>\nexample, the opening sections of Maya Angelou's 1970 memoir, I Know <br>\nWhy the Caged Bird Sings, were transformed into a memorable childhood <br>\nreminiscence of the same title in Harper's Magazine.<br>\nBecause essays may go through so many publishing variations, <br>\nsettling on a precise date for each selection was no easy matter. I <br>\nproceeded largely case by case. Nabokov's 1966 essay on his father <br>\nwas so transformed from its 1950 origins that it seemed only <br>\nreasonable to use the later date. So, too, I decided to use the final <br>\npublication date for John Muir's Alaskan adventures with his <br>\nunforgettable companion Stickeen; it was that version, and not the <br>\nearlier and now forgotten essay, that became his most popular work. <br>\nBut occasionally I thought it would be misleading to use the final <br>\ndate of publication. Langston Hughes's \"Bop,\" for example, clearly <br>\ncomes out of the forties; though it was revised considerably for <br>\nsubsequent book publication, to place it in a later decade would <br>\ndistort its contemporary flavor. An essay like Mark Twain's \"Corn-<br>\npone Opinions,\" never published in the author's lifetime, is listed <br>\nby date of composition.<br>\nFor the reader's convenience, I have attached brief notes to <br>\neach essay outlining its publishing history and supplying relevant <br>\ncontextual information. I have placed an asterisk before the source <br>\nused for this collection. I have also translated foreign words and <br>\nphrases within brackets when it seemed necessary. Additional <br>\ninformation is contained in the Biographical Notes in the back of the <br>\nbook, where I included pertinent information on the writer's career, <br>\nrelevant details to establish a context for the selected essay, and <br>\ntitles of books and collections (with the emphasis on nonfiction) <br>\nthat will direct interested readers to more books by that writer.<br>\nWriters and magazine editors interested in submitting <br>\npublished essays for the annual volumes should send complimentary <br>\nissues, subscriptions, or appropriate material to Robert Atwan, <br>\nSeries Editor, The Best American Essays, Box 220, Readville, <br>\nMassachusetts 02137-9998. Criteria and guidelines can be found in the <br>\nannual book.<br>\nAcknowledgments<br>\nAs I researched books and periodicals for this unprecedented volume, <br>\nI often felt like Henry Adams, poised at the crossroads of two time <br>\nperiods: the rapidly accelerating age of cyberspace that instantly <br>\nfurnishes vast amounts of information and the old-fashioned era of <br>\ndim library stacks and dusty, out-of-print books. The experience was <br>\nboth high-tech and low-tech. If it was satisfying to sit at my desk <br>\nand click a few keys for immediate access to material that only a few <br>\nyears ago would have required frequent library visits, it was even <br>\nmore satisfying to hold in my hand hardcover first editions of books <br>\nlike Martin Luther King's Why We Can't Wait or H. L. Mencken's <br>\nPrejudices. Even obtaining these books involved travel in both <br>\nworlds: through the Internet I could enter my local library's <br>\nregional network, discover books it didn't own, and conveniently <br>\norder them online. A day or two later - and sometimes within hours - <br>\nI would be experiencing the tactile and intellectual pleasures of <br>\nhandling some of the treasured pieces of our literary heritage. For <br>\ntheir invaluable assistance, then, I want to thank especially the <br>\nstaff of the Milton Public Library as well as all the other <br>\ninstitutions connected with the Old Colony Library Network in <br>\nMassachusetts.<br>\nWhat I was unable to find, my researcher could. Much of the <br>\nknottier research - establishing the original source or date of an <br>\nessay, or tracking down an elusive periodical - was performed by <br>\nDonna Ashley, who relied on the superb resources of the libraries at <br>\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Boston <br>\nCollege, and the Boston Public Library. Nearly all of the source <br>\nnotes attached to each essay derive from her dogged research; without <br>\nher assistance this project might have taken another year to <br>\ncomplete. I want to thank, too, Arthur Johnson for his generous help <br>\nin providing permissions data for all of the essays. I borrowed a <br>\ngood deal of biographical information about the essayists from some <br>\nof my previous anthologies and would like to thank a few coeditors <br>\nfor their contributions: Martha Banta, Bruce Forer, Justin Kaplan, <br>\nDonald McQuade, David Minter, Jon Roberts, Robert Stepto, and William <br>\nVesterman. I'm enormously grateful to Charles H. Christensen for his <br>\nadvice and encouragement over the years. The Houghton Mifflin staff <br>\nhas been helpful and supportive as always, and I'd like to thank <br>\nJanet Silver, Sean Lawler, Larry Cooper, Bridget Marmion, Dean <br>\nJohnson, and Bruce Cantley for all their efforts. My wife, Hélène <br>\nAtwan, kindly read over portions of the manuscript and offered many <br>\nvaluable suggestions for which I am very grateful. Finally, it was a <br>\ngreat pleasure to work once again with Joyce Carol Oates. Her broad <br>\nknowledge of American writing and her literary judgment transformed <br>\nwhat seemed like a paralyzing critical task - reducing several <br>\nhundred great essays to a mere fifty-five - into a spirited, <br>\nilluminating assessment of the modern American essayist's struggle to <br>\nencompass the creative energies and social emergencies of a century <br>\nthat had no shortage of either.<br>\nRobert Atwan <br>\n<br>\nIntroduction<br>\nThe Art of the (American) Essay<br>\nHere is a history of America told in many voices.<br>\nIt's an elliptical tale, or a compendium of tales, of the <br>\nAmerican twentieth century by way of individual essays that, fitting <br>\ntogether into a kind of mobile mosaic, suggest where we've come from, <br>\nand who we are, and where we are going. In his probing, <br>\nprovocative \"The Creation Myth of Cooperstown,\" Stephen Jay Gould <br>\nasks: \"Why do we prefer creation myths to evolutionary stories?\" The <br>\nmore we know of history, of both the natural and the civilized <br>\nworlds, the more we understand that our tangled lives are ever <br>\nevolving, and that our culture, far from being timeless, is a living <br>\nexpression of Time.<br>\nThe essay, in its directness and intimacy, in its first-<br>\nperson authority, is the ideal literary form to convey such a vision. <br>\nBy tradition essays have been categorized as formal or informal; yet <br>\nit can be argued that all essays are an expression of the human voice <br>\naddressing an imagined audience, seeking to shift opinion, to <br>\ninfluence judgment, to appeal to another in his or her common <br>\nhumanity. Even the most artfully composed essay suggests a <br>\nnaturalness of discourse. As our precursor Montaigne advised, \"We <br>\nmust remove the mask.\"<br>\nThe essays in this volume have all been written by writers <br>\nwho have published at least one collection of essays or nonfiction. <br>\nNot only did this principle allow the editors a reasonable means of <br>\nlimiting selections, it is an acknowledgment that writing is a <br>\nvocation, not merely an avocation. In a historical overview of a <br>\ncentury virtually teeming with talent, I wanted to honor those <br>\nwriters who have made writing their life's work. I didn't see my role <br>\nas one to reward the lucky amateur who writes a single good essay, <br>\nthen disappears forever. Better to search for little-known but <br>\nexcellent essays by, for instance, writers of historical significance <br>\nlike John Jay Chapman, Jane Addams, Edmund Wilson. Most of the essays <br>\nare \"informal\"; but this isn't to suggest that they are innocent, <br>\nunmediated utterances lacking the stratagems of art. Even Mark <br>\nTwain's \"Corn-pone Opinions,\" delivered in the author's <br>\ncharacteristic forthright voice, is driven by a passionate <br>\nintellectual conviction regarding the gullibility of mankind and the <br>\ntragic consequences of this gullibility.<br>\nMy general theme in the assemblage of this volume has been a <br>\nsearch for the expression of personal experience within the <br>\nhistorical, the individual talent within the tradition (to paraphrase <br>\nT. S. Eliot). My preference was always to essays that, springing from <br>\nintense personal experience, are nonetheless significantly linked to <br>\nlarger issues, even if, as in the case of James Thurber and S. J. <br>\nPerelman, these issues are viewed playfully. The emotion I felt when <br>\nbeginning to read most of the essays gathered here was one of great <br>\nexcitement and anticipation; even, at times, a distinct visceral <br>\nthrill. As an editor, I am primarily a reader. I could not <br>\ncountenance including essays out of duty's sake that, in fact, I <br>\nfound deadly dull. For the many essays considered for this volume, <br>\nthe majority of which ultimately had to be excluded, I was the ideal <br>\nreader: I wanted to like what I read, and I was committed to reading <br>\nthe entire essay with sympathy. If you will substitute \"literature\" <br>\nfor \"poetry\" in this famous remark in a letter of Emily Dickinson's, <br>\nyou have my basic criterion for the work included in The Best <br>\nAmerican Essays of the Century: \"If I read a book [and] it makes my <br>\nwhole body so cold no fire can ever warm me I know that is poetry. If <br>\nI feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know <br>\nthat is poetry.\"<br>\nAnd what powerful openings in certain of these exemplary <br>\nessays:<br>\nWe are met to commemorate the anniversary of one of the most terrible <br>\ncrimes in history - not for the purpose of condemning it, but to <br>\nrepent of our share in it.<br>\n- John Jay Chapman, \"Coatesville\" (1912)<br>\nThe knowledge of the existence of Devil Baby burst upon the residents <br>\nof Hull House one day when three Italian women, with an excited rush <br>\nthrough the door, demanded that he be shown to them.<br>\n- Jane Addams, \"The Devil Baby at Hull-House\" (1916)<br>\nOf course all life is a process of breaking down, but the blows that <br>\ndo the dramatic side of the work - the big sudden blows that come, or <br>\nseem to come, from outside - the ones you remember and blame things <br>\non and, in moments of weakness, tell your friends about, don't show <br>\ntheir effect all at once. There is another sort of blow that comes <br>\nfrom within - that you don't feel until it's too late to do anything <br>\nabout it, until you realize with finality that in some regard you <br>\nwill never be as good a man again.<br>\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"The Crack-Up\" (1936)<br>\nThe cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our <br>\nexistence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of <br>\ndarkness.<br>\n- Vladimir Nabokov, \"Perfect Past\" (1950)<br>\nOn the twenty-ninth of July, in 1943, my father died. On the same <br>\nday, a few hours later, his last child was born. Over a month before <br>\nthis, while all our energies were concentrated in waiting for these <br>\nevents, there had been, in Detroit, one of the bloodiest race riots <br>\nof the century.<br>\n- James Baldwin, \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955)<br>\nThe decaying, downtown shopping section of Memphis - still another <br>\nMain Street - lay, the weekend before Martin Luther King's funeral, <br>\nunder a siege.<br>\n- Elizabeth Hardwick, \"The Apotheosis of Martin Luther King\" (1968)<br>\nWe were all strapped into the seats of the Chinook, fifty of us, and <br>\nsomething, someone was hitting it from the outside with an enormous <br>\nhammer. How do they do that? I thought, we're a thousand feet in the <br>\nair!<br>\n- Michael Herr, \"Illumination Rounds\" (1977)<br>\nWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.<br>\n- Joan Didion, \"The White Album\" (1978)<br>\nOf course there are crucial distinctions between the art of <br>\nthe essay and the art of prose fiction, yet to the reader the <br>\nimmediate experience in reading is an engagement with that mysterious <br>\npresence we call voice. Reading, we \"hear\" another's speech <br>\nreplicated in our heads as if by magic. Where in life we sometimes <br>\n(allegedly infrequently) fall in love at first sight, in reading we <br>\nmay fall in love with the special, singular qualities of another's <br>\nvoice; we may become mesmerized, haunted; we may be provoked, <br>\nshocked, illuminated; we may be galvanized into action; we may be <br>\nenraged, revulsed, and yet! - drawn irresistibly to experience this <br>\nvoice again, and again. It's a writer's unique employment of language <br>\nto which we, as readers, are drawn, though we assume we admire the <br>\nwriter primarily for what he or she \"has to say.\" For consider: how <br>\nmany intelligent, earnest, right-minded commentators published essays <br>\non such important subjects as racial conflict in twentieth-century <br>\nAmerica, social and personal disintegration in the thirties, <br>\nmorality, democracy, nostalgia-for-a-vanishing-America; class <br>\nstruggle, civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Vietnam War, the <br>\nmystical experience of nature, ethnic diversity, various <br>\nAmerican \"myths\" - and how few of these are worth rereading, let <br>\nalone enshrining, in this new century. To be an editor in so massive <br>\nan undertaking, committed to reading with sympathy countless essays <br>\nof high worth and distinction published in the most prestigious <br>\njournals of their era, beginning in about 1900 and sweeping through <br>\nthe decades, is to experience first-hand that quickening of dread, <br>\nwhich Nabokov calls mere \"common sense,\" in the realization of human <br>\nmortality. So many meritorious voices, so much evidence of American <br>\ngood will and wisdom, and so many fallen by the wayside! There were <br>\ntimes when I felt as if I were indeed standing at the edge of an <br>\nabyss, entrusted with rescuing pages of impeccable prose being blown <br>\npast me into oblivion, preserving what I could, surrendering all the <br>\nrest. (Those excellent essayists of a bygone time John Muir, Randolph <br>\nBourne, and John Jay Chapman are preserved here; surrendered to the <br>\nexigencies of space limitations are John Burroughs, George Santayana, <br>\nJoseph Wood Krutch, Ellen Glasgow, and others listed in the Appendix.)<br>\nMy belief is that art should not be comforting; for comfort, <br>\nwe have mass entertainment, and one another. Art should provoke, <br>\ndisturb, arouse our emotions, expand our sympathies in directions we <br>\nmay not anticipate and may not even wish. Art should certainly aspire <br>\nto beauty, but there are myriad sorts of beauty: the presentation of <br>\na subject in the most economical way, for instance; a precise choice <br>\nof language, of detail. There is beauty in the calibrated ugliness of <br>\nthe opening of William Gass's meditation on suicide and art, \"The <br>\nDoomed in Their Sinking,\" because it is so finely calibrated; there <br>\nis beauty in the eloquent, elegiac expression of hurt, rage, and <br>\ndespair in James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son,\" because it is <br>\neloquent and elegiac, in the service of art. That staple of <br>\ntraditional essay collections, the unhurried musings of a disembodied <br>\n(Caucasian, male, privileged) consciousness, is missing here, except <br>\nfor its highest, most lyric expression in E. B. White's classic \"Once <br>\nMore to the Lake\" and its total transmogrification in Edward <br>\nHoagland's powerful \"Heaven and Nature\" - which is about neither <br>\nheaven nor nature. (Hoagland, one of the few American writers who has <br>\nforged a brilliant career out of essays, is our Chopin of the genre. <br>\nThough best known for such nature essays as \"The Courage of <br>\nTurtles,\" \"Red Wolves and Black Bears,\" and \"Earth's Eye,\" in the <br>\ntradition of Thoreau, Hoagland is equally memorable as a recorder of <br>\nstartling, confessional utterances of a kind the very private Thoreau <br>\nwould not have dared.) Though there are deeply moving essays in the <br>\nnostalgic/musing mode by such fine writers as White, James Agee, <br>\nEudora Welty, and John Updike, I have given more space to what might <br>\nbe called a radical expansion of this familiar genre, essays that <br>\nhave the power of personal nostalgia yet are not sentimental, and in <br>\nwhich private contemplation touches on crucial public issues, as Zora <br>\nNeale Hurston's \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\" Richard <br>\nWright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow,\" Baldwin's \"Notes of a <br>\nNative Son,\" Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" N. Scott <br>\nMomaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the <br>\nCaged Bird Sings,\" Richard Rodriguez's \"Aria: A Memoir of a Bilingual <br>\nChildhood,\" and others. If you begin Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone <br>\nHouse\" presuming it to be another nostalgic lament for a vanishing <br>\nAmerica, you will be shocked by the author's conclusion:<br>\nAnd what about me? As I come back in the train, I find that - other <br>\ncauses contributing - my depression of Talcottville deepens. I did <br>\nnot find the river and the forest of my dream - I did not find the <br>\nmagic of the past . . . I would not go back to that old life if I <br>\ncould: the civilization of northern New York - why should I idealize <br>\nit? - was too lonely, too poor, too provincial.<br>\nSimilarly, Donald Hall's \"A Hundred Thousand Straightened Nails\" is <br>\nboth a sympathetic portrait of an older relative of the writer's and <br>\na devastating critique of the romance of American rural eccentricity, <br>\nthe stock material of how many homespun reminiscences in the Norman <br>\nRockwell mode:<br>\n[Washington Woodward] worked hard all his life at being himself, but <br>\nthere were no principles to examine when his life was over . . . The <br>\nlife that he could recall totally was not worth recalling; it was a <br>\nbox of string too short to be saved.<br>\nApart from being first-rate reportage, Joan Didion's \"The White <br>\nAlbum\" can be seen as a radical variant of the genre of nostalgia as <br>\nwell, in which the essayist positions her intimate, interior life <br>\n(\"an attack of vertigo and nausea does not seem to me an <br>\ninappropriate response to the summer of 1968\") within the larger, <br>\nwayward, and \"poorly comprehended\" life of our culture circa 1966-<br>\n1978, with the defiant conclusion \"writing [this] has not yet helped <br>\nme to see what it means\": the antithesis of the traditional essay, <br>\nwhich was organized around a principle, or epiphany, toward which it <br>\nconfidently moved. So too Michael Herr's \"Illumination Rounds,\" from <br>\nDispatches, is appropriately ironically titled, for little is finally <br>\nilluminated in this account of a young American journalist's visit to <br>\nVietnam in the mid-seventies, at the height of that protracted and <br>\ntragic war; the techniques of vividly cinematic fiction writing are <br>\nhere employed in the service of the author's vision, but there is, <br>\nconspicuously, no \"moral\" - no \"moralizing.\" This is the art of the <br>\ncontemporary essay, or memoir: a heightened, trompe l'oeil attention <br>\nto detail that allows the reader to see, hear, witness, as if at <br>\nfirst hand, what the essayist has witnessed. Though this <br>\nis \"informal\" writing, there is no lack of form. Postmodernist <br>\nstrategies of fragmentation and collage have replaced that of <br>\nexposition, summary, and argument.<br>\n<br>\nFor all their diversity, essays tend to fall into three general <br>\ntypes: those that present opinions primarily, and have been written <br>\nto \"instruct\"; those that impart information and knowledge; and those <br>\nthat record personal impressionistic experiences, especially <br>\nmemories. These categories often overlap, of course, as in the <br>\noutstanding essays named above, and in recent years, judging from the <br>\nannual series The Best American Essays, from which essays in this <br>\nvolume published since 1985 have been taken, the genre has evolved <br>\ninto a form closely akin to prose fiction and prose poetry, employing <br>\ndialogue, dramatic scenes, withheld information, suspense.<br>\nThe essay of opinion, of which Montaigne (1533-1592) was an <br>\nearly, highly influential master, was for centuries the <br>\nquintessential essay. Here, you find no dialogue or dramatic scenes, <br>\nonly a rational, reasoning voice. Such an essay is an argument, often <br>\ncouched in conversational terms; its intention is to instruct, to <br>\nilluminate, to influence. Except for editorial and op-ed pages of <br>\nnewspapers, in which they appear in miniature form, and in a very few <br>\ngeneral-interest magazines like Harper's and the Atlantic, such <br>\nessays are not much favored today. In our egalitarian culture we tend <br>\nto feel, rightly or wrongly, that an essayist's opinion is only as <br>\ngood as his or her expertise, and in such uncharted areas as ethics, <br>\nmorals, and general wisdom, whose opinion should be taken more <br>\nseriously than anyone else's? In the past, however, the gentlemanly <br>\nart of opinion-offering was commonplace; Ralph Waldo Emerson is the <br>\nNorth American master of this form. With the publication of \"Nature\" <br>\nin 1836, Emerson's prestige and influence through the whole of the <br>\nnineteenth century was incalculable. Here was a brilliant aphoristic-<br>\nphilosophical mind expressed in an elegantly idiosyncratic language. <br>\nHenry David Thoreau, Emerson's younger contemporary, combines strong <br>\nopinions with a wealth of observed information and firsthand <br>\nexperience in a crystalline, poetic prose, and for this reason seems <br>\nto us more modern, and far more accessible, than Emerson. There is a <br>\nrich subcategory of American essays, the confrontation of nature by a <br>\nrefined, fastidiously observing consciousness, that has descended to <br>\nus from Thoreau; I would have dearly liked to include more <br>\npractitioners of this sort but had room for only John Muir, Rachel <br>\nCarson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, and Gretel Ehrlich. (But all <br>\nthese essays are gems.) In general, our patience tends to wear thin <br>\nwhen we're confronted with sermonizing in its many forms; I most <br>\noften encountered such essays among those published in the first four <br>\nor five decades of the century, when magazines seemed to have <br>\nunlimited space for rambling, genial prose by men with nothing <br>\nespecially urgent on their minds apart from platitudes of nature and <br>\nmorality. Who were the readers of these essays, I wondered. The more <br>\nelusive the subject, the more verbose the style, as in two <br>\nfascinating masterpieces of ellipsis, indirection, and irresolution <br>\nby Henry James at his most baroque, \"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\n(1910) and \"Within the Rim\" (1915). (\"Is There a Life after Death?\" <br>\nwas initially included in this volume, and then reluctantly excluded; <br>\nthen included again, and finally excluded. A longtime admirer of <br>\nHenry James, I wanted badly for him to be represented, but the essay <br>\nis, one might say, \"Jamesian,\" and long, and could hardly be <br>\njustified as among the best of the century. And \"Within the Rim,\" on <br>\nthe apparent theme of war, is even more abstruse.)<br>\nYet for all their unfashionableness, the opinion essays <br>\nincluded here are, I think, excellent, and will repay the sort of <br>\nclose, sympathetic reading required for prose that isn't immediately <br>\ngripping and specific. Henry Adams's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" from <br>\nthe classic The Education of Henry Adams, is a bravura work of <br>\nastonishing intellectual abstraction; written nearly one hundred <br>\nyears ago, it strikes a disturbingly contemporary note in its somber <br>\ncontemplation of a mechanistic universe reduced to a series <br>\nof \"relations\" and mankind itself reduced to \"Motion in a universe of <br>\nMotions, with an acceleration . . . of vertiginous violence.\" With <br>\nthe authority of science, Adams says, history has no right to meddle, <br>\nsince science \"now lay in a plane where scarcely one or two hundred <br>\nminds in the world could follow its mathematical processes.\" <br>\nFittingly, William James's famous \"The Moral Equivalent of War\" was <br>\nwritten in the same year, 1910, as Henry James's \"Is There a Life <br>\nafter Death?\" Though William James is a far more lucid prose stylist <br>\nthan his younger brother, both brothers are concerned with profound <br>\nquestions of life and death; William James broods upon the future of <br>\ncivilization itself in a prophetic work that looks ahead to Freud's <br>\nlate, melancholic Civilization and Its Discontents (1930). What is <br>\nhistory but a bloodbath? \"The horrors make the fascination. War is <br>\nthe strong life; it is life in extremis; war-taxes are the only ones <br>\nmen never hesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us.\" <br>\nJohn Jay Chapman, once considered an essayist of nearly Emerson's <br>\nstature, is not much read today, yet his passionate meditation upon a <br>\nnotorious lynching that took place in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in <br>\n1911 transcends its time and tragic circumstances.<br>\nThe two most influential literary essays of the twentieth <br>\ncentury are perhaps T. S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual <br>\nTalent\" (\"The emotion of art is impersonal\") and Robert Frost's \"The <br>\nFigure a Poem Makes\" (\"No tears in the writer, no tears in the <br>\nreader\"); each gains from being read in conjunction with the other. <br>\nSui generis is Gertrude Stein's \"What Are Master-pieces and Why Are <br>\nThere So Few of Them,\" itself a masterpiece of polemics, an argument <br>\nthat convinces by sheer repetition:<br>\n. . . One has not identity [when] one is in the act of doing <br>\nanything. Identity is recognition, you know who you are because you <br>\nand others remember anything about yourself but essentially you are <br>\nnot that when you are doing anything. I am I because my little dog <br>\nknows me but, creatively speaking the little dog knowing that you are <br>\nyou and your recognizing that he knows, is what destroys creation.<br>\nH. L. Mencken's \"The Hills of Zion\" is, like many of <br>\nMencken's essays and columns, a passionate repudiation of evangelical <br>\nChristianity and anti-intellectualism. This is sermonizing disguised <br>\nas social satire, zestful in its accumulation of damning details; one <br>\ncan see why the young Negro Richard Wright was so impressed by <br>\nMencken's example, seeing the older white man as \"fighting, fighting <br>\nwith words . . . using words as a weapon . . . as one would use a <br>\nclub.\" Katherine Anne Porter's \"The Future Is Now\" is an almost <br>\npurely cerebral opinion piece, less compelling perhaps than Porter's <br>\nelegantly composed short stories, but gracefully argued nonetheless, <br>\nwhile \"Artists in Uniform,\" one of Mary McCarthy's most anthologized <br>\nessays, smoothly combines her satirical gifts with her passion for <br>\nintellectual discourse. Susan Sontag's \"Notes on Camp\" is both <br>\nopinion essay and cultural criticism of a high order; Adrienne Rich's <br>\ndramatically fragmented \"Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying\" might <br>\nbe defined as an essay of opinion in a unique, poetic form. Essays by <br>\nAlice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, N. Scott Momaday, and Cynthia Ozick <br>\nadvance arguments by means of an accumulation of memoirist detail, <br>\nand each presents us with the wonder of how, in Ozick's words, \"a <br>\nwriter is dreamed and transfigured into being.\" And essays that seem <br>\nto be primarily concerned with the imparting of information and <br>\ndescription, like Loren Eiseley's \"The Brown Wasps,\" Tom <br>\nWolfe's \"Putting Daddy On,\" Elizabeth Hardwick's \"The Apotheosis of <br>\nMartin Luther King,\" Lewis Thomas's \"The Lives of a Cell,\" Annie <br>\nDillard's \"Total Eclipse,\" among others, contain arguments of <br>\nsubtlety and insight. Saul Bellow's \"Graven Images\" is a meditation <br>\nin the author's characteristic ironic mode on photography as a <br>\nviolation of personal dignity and privacy and the \"revolutionary <br>\ntransformation\" of a world that no longer honors such values. John <br>\nMcPhee's wonderfully original \"The Search for Marvin Gardens\" makes <br>\nof the popular American board game an allegory of capitalist <br>\nadventure, and rewards us with the unexpected discovery of the <br>\nsecluded middle-class bastion Marvin Gardens, the security-<br>\npatrolled \"suburb within a suburb\" that is one's reward for winning <br>\nthe game.<br>\nThe earliest essay in the anthology, Mark Twain's \"Corn-pone <br>\nOpinions,\" is a superbly modulated argument that begins with an <br>\nengaging portrait of a young black slave (this is the Missouri of <br>\nTwain's childhood, in the 1850s) and proceeds to a ringing <br>\ndenunciation of cultural chauvinism that is as relevant to our time <br>\nas it was to Twain's:<br>\nBroadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly <br>\nspeaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is <br>\nacquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is <br>\nconformity.<br>\nBy which Twain means that deathly conformity that leads to an <br>\nacceptance of slavery, lynchings, white bigotry, and injustice in a <br>\nnation constituted as a democracy.<br>\nTwain's essay strikes a chord that resounds through the <br>\nanthology: the ever-shifting, ever-evolving issue of race in America. <br>\nIt can't be an accident that the essays in this volume by men and <br>\nwomen of ethnic minority backgrounds are outstanding; to paraphrase <br>\nMelville, to write a \"mighty\" work of prose you must have a \"mighty\" <br>\ntheme. And what mightier, what more challenging and passionate theme <br>\nfor both writer and reader than how it feels to be of minority status <br>\nin America, from the time of W.E.B. Du Bois in the first decade of <br>\nthe century to our contemporaries Maya Angelou, N. Scott Momaday, <br>\nMaxine Hong Kingston, Alice Walker, Richard Rodriguez, and Gerald <br>\nEarly? For historical reasons obviously having to do with slavery, <br>\nthe experience of blacks in America has been significantly different <br>\nfrom that of other minorities, and this fact is reflected in the <br>\nessays included here.<br>\nW.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" from The Souls of <br>\nBlack Folk (1903), is a chillingly prophetic work that traces the <br>\nintellectual and spiritual evolution of a seemingly ordinary black <br>\nboy from southeastern Georgia who is sent north to be educated in a <br>\nNegro school, returns after seven years to his hometown so thoroughly <br>\nchanged that he seems more foreign to his former relatives and <br>\nneighbors than a Georgian white man would be, and is given advice by <br>\nthe kindly white Judge:<br>\n\". . . You and I both know, John, that in this country the Negro must <br>\nremain subordinate, and can never expect to be the equal of white <br>\nmen. In their place, you people can be honest and respectful; and God <br>\nknows, I'll do what I can to help them. But when they want to reverse <br>\nnature . . . by God! we'll hold them under if we have to lynch every <br>\nNigger in the land.\"<br>\nZora Neale Hurston in \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me\" (1928) defines <br>\nherself very differently from Du Bois's tragic protagonist, partly <br>\nbecause she has been raised in a \"colored town\" in Florida, <br>\nEatonville. Her defiance strikes us as courageous, and touching:<br>\nAt certain times I have no race, I am me . . . Sometimes, I feel <br>\ndiscriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely <br>\nastonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my <br>\ncompany! It's beyond me.<br>\nRichard Wright's \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow: An Autobiographical <br>\nSketch,\" the preface to Wright's 1938 collection of novellas, Uncle <br>\nTom's Children, would become a section of his heralded Black Boy <br>\n(1945). Wright's education in Jim Crow \"wisdom\" begins ironically <br>\nwith a beating his mother gives him for having dared to fight with <br>\nwhite boys, and carries him into a prematurely cynical adolescence; <br>\nit's a vision of the American South contiguous with that of New York <br>\nCity in the 1940s experienced by Langston Hughes.<br>\nPerhaps the preeminent essayist of the American twentieth <br>\ncentury is James Baldwin, and it seems fitting that Baldwin wrote his <br>\nmost powerful and influential nonfiction works, Notes of a Native <br>\nSon, Nobody Knows My Name, and The Fire Next Time, at about <br>\nmidcentury. Baldwin was a natural master of a kind of nonfiction <br>\nnarration we associate with the most engaging fiction, in which <br>\npersonal, familial experience is linked with a larger social and <br>\npolitical context that enhances it as myth. Like his mentor Richard <br>\nWright, James Baldwin was a poet of irony; his bitterness and rage at <br>\nsocial injustice was so finely distilled, his use of language so <br>\nimpassioned and fluent, he made of the most tragically debased <br>\nmaterials a world of startling beauty. Baldwin's is a secular <br>\nmystical vision that seems to us quintessentially American:<br>\nAll of my [newly deceased] father's texts and songs, which I had <br>\ndecided were meaningless, were arranged before me at his death like <br>\nempty bottles, waiting to hold the meaning which life would give them <br>\nfor me. This was his legacy: nothing is ever escaped . . . The dead <br>\nman mattered, the new life mattered; blackness and whiteness did not <br>\nmatter; to believe they did was to acquiesce in one's own <br>\ndestruction. Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to <br>\ndestroy the man who hated and this man was an immutable law.<br>\nThis is the vision of Martin Luther King, Jr., expressed in <br>\nhis historic 1963 \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\": \"One who breaks an <br>\nunjust law must do it openly, lovingly . . . and with a willingness <br>\nto accept the penalty.\"<br>\n<br>\nRobert Atwan, who has been an invaluable series editor for the highly <br>\nregarded The Best American Essays since its inception in 1986, <br>\nassisted me tirelessly and with inspiration in our months-long effort <br>\nof sifting through any and all essays that were possibilities for <br>\nthis anthology. We have been limited, or, one might say, assisted, in <br>\nour selections only since 1986, being obliged to choose essays from <br>\nthe series anthology after that date; before 1986, we had no <br>\nrestrictions. Our decision to reprint essays only by writers who have <br>\npublished nonfiction books helped to limit our search, as did our <br>\nexclusion of journalism, excepting unique reportage like <br>\nHemingway's \"Pamplona in July\" and Michael Herr's \"Illumination <br>\nRounds.\" We hoped to avoid prose fiction in essay form, though such <br>\nprose pieces as W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John\" and Langston <br>\nHughes's \"Bop\" certainly employ fictional techniques; we excluded <br>\nliterary criticism - though some of our finest writers, like Randall <br>\nJarrell, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling, have excelled in it - <br>\nand footnote-laden academic essays for a limited readership, even by <br>\nHannah Arendt. Much as I wanted to include Henry James, as I've noted <br>\nabove, I could not justify reprinting a long, convoluted skein of <br>\nwords that few readers would read. Nor could I include another major <br>\ntwentieth-century writer, Willa Cather, whose available essays were <br>\nsimply inappropriate, and lengthy. Of Norman Mailer's nonfiction <br>\nwork, \"The Fight\" would have been my choice for this volume, but it's <br>\nbook length (and has already appeared in The Best American Sports <br>\nWriting of the Century); other essays of Mailer's, like \"The White <br>\nNegro,\" controversial in their time, are badly dated today. Gay <br>\nTalese, a brilliant practitioner of what has come to be known as New <br>\nJournalism, has written no \"essays\" per se. William Carlos Williams, <br>\nRalph Ellison, John Hersey, Wallace Stegner, Barbara Tuchman, Gore <br>\nVidal, most painfully William Faulkner: these important writers had <br>\nno single appropriate essay. Faulkner in particular seems to have had <br>\nlittle aptitude, or perhaps inspiration, for the essay form.<br>\nOf contemporary essayists there are so many - so very many! - <br>\nwho might well be included here, it isn't possible to list their <br>\nnames except in the Appendix. Quite apart from the numerous memoirs <br>\nof high quality being written today, and published to much acclaim, <br>\nthis is a remarkably fruitful era for the personal essay. The <br>\ntriumph, one might say, of the mysterious pronoun \"I.\"<br>\nIt was the aim of the editors to tell a more or less <br>\nchronological story of America as the century unfolded, with <br>\nrepresentative essays from each decade, as we have done; yet, the <br>\nreader will note, the traumatic experiences of World War II, vividly <br>\ndescribed by William Manchester in \"Okinawa: The Bloodiest Battle of <br>\nAll,\" does not appear in the forties but decades later, in 1987; and <br>\nnumerous other essays, stimulated by memory and meditation, have been <br>\nwritten years after the occasion of their subjects. The ideal essay, <br>\nin any case, is as timeless as any work of art, transcending the <br>\ncircumstances of its inception. It moves, as Robert Frost says of the <br>\nideal poem, from delight to wisdom, and \"rides on its own melting,\" <br>\nlike ice on a hot stove.<br>\nJoyce Carol Oates <br>\n<br>\nCopyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company<br>\nIntroduction copyright © 2000 by The Ontario Review Inc.<br>\nAll rights reserved",
      "synopsis": "<p><p>This singular collection is nothing less than a political, spiritual, and intensely personal record of America&#8217;s tumultuous modern age, as experienced by our foremost critics, commentators, activists, and artists. Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience.<br> From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s &#147;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&#8221; these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, &#147;into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we&#8217;ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.&#8221; Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4><b>Bookseller Reviews</b> \n<p>These essays educate us, amuse us, startle us with their immediacy. Who among us can read Henry Adam's \"A Law of Acceleration,\" penned in 1904, and not think of our mind-zapping digital age? Who could resist the first sentence of Zora Neale Hurston's piece:I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother's side was not an Indian chief.\" And which of you could disagree with the unrepeatable wisdom of Gertrude Stein's \"The tradition has always been that you may more or less describe the things that happen nowadays everybody all day long knows what is happening and so what is happening is not really interesting.\"</p>\n<p>The essays that Joyce Carol Oates has selected linger with us, not because their authors (from Mark Twain to Martin Luther King), retain their fame, but because each piece is a talisman, irreducible and well-carved. James Age's prose-poems \"Knoxville, Summer of 1915\" appeals to us today just as it inspired composer Samuel Barber decades ago, and two thirds of a century have only enhanced the thrall of the languorous rhythms of Edmund Wilson's \"The Old Stone House.\" H.L. Mencken's article on the 1925 Scopes trial shames this week's pale convention prose with its freshness, and T.S. Eliot's 1919 \"Tradition and The Individual Talent\" still has something to teach us.</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>\"Here is a history of America told in many voices,\" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy's \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities. QPB and History Book Club selections; BOMC alternate. Sept. Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>\". . . Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces <br>\nreflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of <br>\nvarious American identities.\"\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>In her excellent introduction to this collection, Joyce Carol Oates states her belief that \"art should not be comforting.\" It should, instead, \"provoke, disturb,...and expand our sympathies in directions we may not anticipate and may not even wish.\" The reader should therefore be prepared to have these 55 carefully selected essays do just that. Arranged chronologically, the essays span the century with an average of five essays per decade. From Mark Twain to Saul Bellow by way of William James, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost and Gertrude Stein, the collection notes literary trends as well as social upheavals as recorded in essays of W.E.B DuBois, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright. Chosen from authors who had published at least one book of nonfiction or essays, this collection attempts to present a \"mobile mosaic\" of 20th-century America. Category: Collections. KLIATT Codes: SA—Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2001, Houghton Mifflin, 624p., Ages 16 to adult. Reviewer: Patricia A. Moore; Brookline, MA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>One of the pleasures of an anthology like this is reading people you might not otherwise have picked up. Like John Muir, whose \"Stickeen,\" a life-and-death adventure on an Alaskan glacier with a singular small black dog, is a great piece of adventure writing. Or Jane Addams, whose insights into the spread of an urban legend of \"The Devil Baby at Hull House\" are thoughtful and compassionate. Another sort of pleasure comes from rereading familiar works in a new context: E.B. White's \"Once More to the Lake,\" N. Scott Momaday's \"The Way to Rainy Mountain,\" John McPhee's \"The Search for Marvin Gardens,\" and Annie Dillard's \"Total Eclipse.\" Only seven of the essays come from the annual \"Best American Essays\" series that Atwan has coedited since 1986. The other 48 were culled from the rest of the century, with the ruling idea, Atwan says, \"that the essays should speak to the present, not merely represent the past.\" Oates looked \"for the expression of personal experience within the historical.\" They have created a mosaic of a century in an America whose dominant and recurring theme has been race. Essential for most libraries.--Mary Paumier Jones, Westminster P.L., CO Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\\\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Megan Harlan</h4>...all the essays transcend fashion and speak just as eloquestly to us today as they did when they were first published.<br>\n—<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>\n\n</article>"

Poets range from Robert Pinsky, William Carlos Williams, and Elizabeth Bishop to Charles Simic, Billy Collins, and Rita Dove. Schmidt’s spirited introductions place the poets and their poems in historical and literary context and shine light on the interesting and often uneasy relationship between politics and art.

Before that, since its inception in 1935, the post was called consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. So far we've had 43 of them, including some of America's most famous and best-loved poets, such as Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, and, of course, Billy Collins, perhaps the most popular poet to hold the title (2001–2003), and also the author of the foreword to this enjoyable anthology, which offers a sampling of work from all 43 laureates, plus short introductions about each one. Former New York Times Book Review poetry editor Schmidt calls the laureates \"the gatekeepers of the American idiom,\" and above all, that's what a reader will find here: a good sampling of what the mainstream of American poetry has to offer--the careful descriptions of Bishop, the powerful critiques of Brooks, the surreal landscapes of Simic, Merwin's deep images, Bogan's careful stanzas, Lowell's blustery lines. There are a few occasional poems, but mostly, it's a gathering of great poets hanging together because they held an important job. This will be a wonderful holiday gift for poetry lovers. (Oct.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>\"Be careful what you say to us now./ The street-lamp is smashed, the window is jagged,/ There is a man dead in his blood by the base of the fountain./ If you speak/ You cannot be delicate or sad or clever.\" With these lines, Josephine Jacobsen reminds readers that despite all the hardship in the world, poetry is there to report. With this sweeping behemoth of an anthology, Norton and the Library of Congress have given readers and libraries an excellent excuse to own another book. Schmidt, former poetry editor for the New York Times Book Review, has included all of the Poet Laureate Consultants (commonly known as U.S. Poet Laureates) from Joseph Auslander (1937–41) to Kay Ryan (2007–10). Even newly named Poet Laureate W.S. Merwin is included because he served as Special Bicentennial Consultant with Rita Dove and Louise Glück (1999–2000). Schmidt gives readers a fine selection of poems for each poet, some expected and some surprises. In addition, she includes introductions that place poets in social and literary context and elaborates their contributions to the office of Consultant. For example, William Carlos Williams's term was mired in Communist controversy and health problems, and while appointed, he never served. VERDICT A hefty and worthy read that everyone will want to savor. Essential for all contemporary poetry collections.—Karla Huston, Appleton Arts Ctr., WI\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><P>Through poetry, fiction, essays, song lyrics, letters, and memoirs, this authoritative single-volume collection of Beat literature captures the triumphant energy of a movement that swept through American letters with hurricane force. <P>Featuring&#58; Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gary Snyder, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, Diane Di Prima, Bob Dylan, Ken Kesey, Charles Bukowski, Michael McClure, and more.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Cutting through bohemian posturing and excess, Charters here reprints much of the most vital, readable and relevant material produced by the Beat generation, primarily in the 1950s and '60s, with some selections from the '70s and '80s. The novels of such leading figures as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs lend themselves well to excerpting, giving this volume creditable ballast. Representative works of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder are included along with those of lesser-known Beats (e.g., John Clellon Holmes), fellow travelers like Frank O'Hara and Amiri Baraka, and wives and girlfriends often overlooked at the time, including Hettie Jones, Carolyn Cassady and Joyce Johnson. Charters ( Kerouac ) offers a broad perspective on this seminal literary movement: she links East Coast Beats to the San Francisco Renaissance poets; pays attention to such latter-day Beats as Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg; and explains the position of non-Beat but related writers--Alan Watts, Anne Waldman, Diane DiPrima and the young Norman Mailer--in her helpful introductory essay and notes preceeding each entry. Her energizing, liberating anthology makes it clear that such Beat preoccupations as the bomb, the meaninglessness of modern existence and ecological destruction remain current. ( Jan. )</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><P>Dazzling in its range, exhilarating in its immediacy and grace, this collection gathers together, from every region of the country and from the past forty years, the poems that continue to shape our imaginations. From Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and Adrienne Rich, to Robert Haas and Louise Gluck, this anthology takes the full measure of our poetry's daring energies and its tender understandings.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                                        </h4>Poetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Alluding to the anthology wars of a generation ago, McClatchy writes in his introduction that his choices are strictly nonpartisan (neither ``Paleface or Redskin, or Academic and Avant-Garde''). But from the 65 poets he has selected to represent the course of American poetry over the last half century--beginning with Robert Lowell and ending with Jorie Graham--it is clear his preferences are formalistic and academic. The typical poem a reader will encounter in these pages is urbane, finely honed, and smoothly accomplished. As in all anthologies, the omissions and inclusions are telling. Where are Rexroth, Kees, and Rukeyser? Why Cunningham, Bowers, Feldman, and Garrigue and not Ignatow, Brooks, Blackburn, and Bly? While it is a delight to have many of the poets McClatchy has chosen collected together in a reasonably priced edition, a greater variety of voice and aesthetic would have made this anthology a livelier survey of the state of contemporary American poetry. Still, it is a useful addition to most collections. For the 100 most anthologized poems in English, see review of The Concise Columbia Book of Poetry, p. 74.--Ed.-- Christine Sten strom, New York Law Sch. Lib.\n\n</article>"

Organized chronologically with a thematic appendix and streamlined apparatus, this anthology can be taylored to however the course is taught. Individual Fiction, Poetry, and Drama introductions provide an overview for reading and analyzing each genre, defining key terms in context. More than a third of the selections overall represent voices of women, people of color, and writers from cultures outside the United States, and a strong effort has been made to include work that reflects contemporary social questions and will stimulate classroom discussion. New poems, stories, and plays are among the changes to the Fourth Edition.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>For several years, Wally Lamb, the author of two of the most beloved novels of our time, has run a writing workshop at the York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's only maximum-security prison for women. Writing, Lamb discovered, was a way for these women to face their fears and failures and begin to imagine better lives. <b>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</b>, a collection of their essays, was published in 2003 to great critical acclaim. With <b>I'll Fly Away</b>, Lamb offers readers a new volume of intimate pieces from the York workshop. Startling, heartbreaking, and inspiring, these stories are as varied as the individuals who wrote them, but each illuminates an important core truth: that a life <b>can</b> be altered through self-awareness and the power of the written word.</p>",
      "excerpt": "<b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison \n<p><b>Chapter One</b></p>\n<p class=\"null1\">Florida Memories</p>\n<p>By Bonnie Jean Foreshaw</p>\n<p>It's Thursday morning at 6:00 <small>A.M.</small>, and we two have just arrived at the open-air flea market, the largest in south Florida. I'm an apprentice shopper and my teacher is my Aunt Mandy. Later this morning, the market will be hot and crowded—alive with music, laughter, gossip, and bartering about the price of everything from necklaces to nectarines. But at the moment, it's cool and quiet. Our focus is fish.</p>\n<p>\"Pay close attention to the <i>eyes</i> of the fish,\" Aunt Mandy instructs as we walk from stall to stall. \"If the eyes are clear, not cloudy, and the color of the skin's not fading, then the fish is fresh.\" Auntie's dressed for shopping in a pink sleeveless blouse, burgundy pedal pushers, Italian sandals, and a white sun visor. I'm wearing shorts, a T-shirt, and rubber flip-flops. I am tall for my age, and starting to get the kind of shape men take a second look at. My glasses take up half my face. \"But you have to shop with your finger and your nose, too, not just your eyes,\" Auntie instructs. \"Poke the fish gently near its fin. If it leaves a dent, then you don't want it. If it doesn't, it's probably part of the morning's catch. And listen to me, Jeannie. Fresh fish never smells foul.\"</p>\n<p>We stop at one of the stalls where the fish are lined up, one against the other, on a bed of ice. The fish man approaches us. He's handsome—black hair, hazel eyes, tank top and cut-off jeans. \"May I help you, ma'am?\" I watch him take in Aunt Mandy's curves, her green eyes andhoney-colored complexion. I might as well be invisible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, maybe you can,\" Auntie says. \"Oh, by the way, I'm Mandy and this is my niece, Jeannie. Now what's your name?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm Ricardo,\" the fish man says. He's sucking in his stomach, and his feet are moving up and down like he's trying to stretch his height. \"It's nice to meet you, Mandy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nice to meet you, too. Now tell me, Ricardo, how much you want for these five yellowtails?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's see. They're seventy-five cents apiece, so that's a total of . . .\"</p>\n<p>He stops to watch Auntie pass her fingers through her shoulder-length hair. It's salt-and-pepper-colored, but Mandy's still got it. \"Uh, three seventy-five.\" \"Oh,\" Auntie says, half-shocked and half-disappointed. \"That fellow three stalls down says he's selling his yellowtails for <i>fifty</i> cents each. So unless we can work out a deal . . .\"</p>\n<p>The smile drops off of Mr. Ricardo's face, but Auntie's smile returns. Her gold tooth is glimmering. She shifts her weight, puts her hand on her hip.</p>\n<p>\"Mandy, it's a deal,\" Ricardo says. \"Five yellowtails for two-fifty. That's a dollar twenty-five cut I'm giving you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which I appreciate,\" Auntie says. \"And look at it this way: you've just gained yourself a faithful customer. Now, tell me. How much you selling those red snappers for? If I can get them for the same price as the yellowtails, I'll buy some of them, too. And conch.\"</p>\n<p>I stand there looking from one to the other. Auntie touches the small gold cross at her throat. She fingers her earring. I can tell Mr. Ricardo is only pretending to do the math in his head. \"Okay,\" he finally says. \"Sold.\"</p>\n<p>Auntie pays for the fish and conch, thanks him, and we walk away. A few stalls down from Mr. Ricardo's, she turns to me. \"Okay, now,\" she says. \"Show me a fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I go up and down the row, looking each fish in the eye, then pick one up by its tail. I turn it, look at its other eye, study its coloration. When I press my finger against its head, near the fin, there's no indentation. \"This one.\"</p>\n<p>Her look is serious. \"You think this fish is fresh?\"</p>\n<p>I hesitate. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Aunt Mandy flashes me her gold-toothed smile. \"Well, Jeannie, now you know how to pick fresh fish.\"</p>\n<p>I'm excited to have passed the test, but I've been wondering something. \"Auntie?\" I say. \"I don't remember going to any other fish stalls before we went to Mr. Ricardo's.\"</p>\n<p>She laughs. \"You and I knew that, but Ricardo didn't. It's one of the tricks of the trade when you shop at the flea market. But bear in mind, Ricardo would rather make a sale than not sell. If he has fish left at the end of the day, that's a loss and a waste for him. So we were doing him a favor. Now, come on. Let's cross the street and I'll teach you how to pick out vegetables and fruit.\"</p>\n<p>We meander among the tomatoes and squashes, the potatoes and mangoes and plums. Shopping for fresh produce is a matter of looking and smelling, but mostly of <i>feeling</i>, Auntie says. \"Fruits and vegetables can get damaged by cold weather, the way they're packed, or how far they've traveled to get to the market. If the skin is firm, that means it's fresh. If it's loose, then it isn't. And always check for bruises.\"</p>\n<p>Although I'm listening to my aunt, it's the peaches in the stall to my right that have my attention. They're big and beautiful, golden yellow with blushes of pink, and their aroma makes my mouth juice up. I'm thinking about how I might get myself one of those peaches.</p>\n<p>\"Pick us out some bananas,\" Auntie says. It's test number two.</p>\n<p>My eyes pass over several bunches before I pick one up. I check each banana, one by one, then walk over to Auntie, who is examining pears. \"These are nice, firm, and yellow,\" I say, handing her the bunch I've chosen. \"Tight skin, no bruises.\"</p>\n<p>She twists the bunch back and forth, then nods her approval. \"Good job,\" she says. Smiling all over myself, I decide to seize the moment. \"Auntie, may I get a few peaches?\"</p>\n<i><b>I'll Fly Away</b><br>\nFurther Testimonies from the Women of York Prison</i>.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>In 1998, Wally Lamb began teaching writing to female convicts at Connecticut's York Correctional Institute. It was not for lack of a résumé; he was already an acclaimed novelist (<i>I Know This Much Is True; She's Come Undone</i>) and had been teaching high school for a quarter century. York was something different. After adjusting to his new constituency, Lamb realized that his students had disarming, often frightening stories to tell. In 2003, he published an anthology of these testimonies, the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award-winning <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>. This follow-up collection is just as bracing and profound.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booklist</h4>\"Lamb . . . continues to offer readers an intimate look at women struggling to maintain their humanity.\"\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4><p>Novelist Lamb's (<i>I Know This Much Is True</i>) second collection of writing by the students in his writing workshop at the maximum-security York Correctional Institution in Connecticut, after <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>(2003), also focuses on the inspiring and raw emotions of women sharing the good and bad memories that shaped them. The 20 women whose work is featured here-18 inmates and two of Lamb's cofacilitators-show that writing is not just a way of capturing their most private thoughts and gripping emotions (e.g., hope, despair, courage), but also a powerful tool to foster hope and healing. They write from the heart in works ranging from poems to essays to short stories; each vignette is more compelling than the one before it. Highly recommended for academic and public libraries.<br>\n—Susan McClellan</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>The second accomplished collection of writings from women incarcerated in Connecticut's York Correctional Institution, edited again by bestselling novelist Lamb (Couldn't Keep It to Myself: Testimonies from Our Imprisoned Sisters, 2003, etc.). One would have thought the first volume, with its probing examinations of lives run amok, would have convinced prison authorities of the value of a writing program in which prisoners focus and take account. But the prison bureaucracy tried to shut it down, writes an incredulous and furious Lamb, and they confiscated the prisoners' material. That particular draconian administration was replaced with a more enlightened group, Lamb reports, one that allowed for the rehabilitative value of writing. These works radiate what Lamb saw as the program's critical mission: to give the women wings \"to hover above the confounding maze of their lives, and from that perspective . . . to see the patterns and dead ends of their past, and a way out.\" Some of the stories are rueful, others bitter, but all bite, even-perhaps especially-when they are gentle. None are self-pitying, but none shy away from speaking directly to the gross cruelties so often inflicted on their early years or young marriages. Each story, no matter how grim or gritty, shows polish, and the women display a wide array of emotions: unbridled anger, innocence, hope, resigned acceptance. While a few of the stories speak of angels who touched the women's lives, most display open wounds that are continuing to be healed by the cathartic power of words. Writing as an act of self-realization and liberation and, not incidentally, an indictment of the penal system.\n\n</article>"

      "excerpt": "<b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> <b>Environmental Writing Since Thoreau</b> <br>\n <b>By Bill McKibben</b> <br>\n <b>THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> <b>Copyright © 2008</b> <b>Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY.<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n <b>ISBN: 978-1-59853-020-9</b> <br>\n <br>\n<br>\n <br>\n <b>Chapter One</b> <b>HENRY DAVID THOREAU</b> \n<p>Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was born, grew up, lived out his life, and died in Concord, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard from 1833 to 1837, then signed on as a teacher at Concord Academy but was dismissed for refusing to whip students. He and his brother John opened an elementary school in 1838, where, according to some authorities, they invented the idea of the field trip. John became sick in 1841 and the brothers closed the school; Henry went to live with Ralph Waldo Emerson, beginning a long friendship with him and with the other members of the Transcendental Club, among them Bronson Alcott and Margaret Fuller. The other transcendentalists experimented with communes like Brook Farm, but Thoreau was more solitary, and the most important years in his life began in 1845 when he took up residence in a small cabin he'd built on the shore of Walden Pond a short walk from town. He spent two years, two months, and two days there, experimenting with simplifying his life. Thorean's isolation at Walden wasn't absolute or deliberately ascetic-he often returned to town to see friends and eat meals, had a steady stream of visitors (often too steady for his taste), and at one point engaged in a political protest, spending a night in Concord jail for his refusal to pay his poll tax. But it was notably productive: he returned to town with the draft of one book (<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>) and the notes that he would spend the next six years turning into <i>Walden</i> (1854), perhaps the most remarkable book in the American canon. As dense as scripture, crowded with aphorism, <i>Walden</i> is full of enough ideas for a score of ordinary books. But it has lived as long and as fully as any other writing of its vintage and inspired all the best kinds of people: both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. claimed him as a major influence. Thoreau suffered from tuberculosis contracted during his college years: his condition worsened beginning in 1859, and he spent his last years revising his accounts of the Maine woods and other works. As he neared death his aunt Louisa asked him if he had made his peace with God. \"I did not know we had ever quarreled,\" he said. He died at the age of 44.</p>\n<p>Picking a few fragments from his writings is an impossible task: an anthology of American environmental writing might well be one-third Thoreau. Here are a few entries from his copious journals, and then the description from <i>Walden</i> of the building of the famous cabin. \"Huckleberries,\" a late essay or lecture-text, shows the modern nature essay being born, with a small root giving way to a luxuriant growth of thought and speculation.</p>\n<p><b><i>from Journals</i></b></p>\n<p>Oct. 24th 1837.</p>\n<p>The Mould our Deeds Leave.</p>\n<p>Every part of nature teaches that the passing away of one life is the making room for another. The oak dies down to the ground, leaving within its rind a rich virgin mould, which will impart a vigorous life to an infant forest - - The pine leaves a sandy and sterile soil-the harder woods a strong and fruitful mould. - -</p>\n<p>So this constant abrasion and decay makes the soil of my future growth. As I live now so shall I reap. If I grow pines and birches, my virgin mould will not sustain the oak, but pines and birches, or, perchance, weeds and brambles, will constitute my second growth. - -</p>\n<p>March 6th 1838</p>\n<p>- - How can a man sit down and quietly pare his nails, while the earth goes gyrating ahead amid such a din of sphere music, whirling him along about her axis some twenty four thousand miles between sun and sun? but mainly in a circle some two millions of miles actual progress. And then such a hurly-burly on the surface-wind always blowing-now a zephyr, now a hurricane-tides never idle, ever fluctuating, no rest for Niagara, but perpetual ran-tan on those limestone rocks-and then that summer simmering which our ears are used to-which would otherwise be christened confusion worse confounded, but is now ironically called \"silence audible\"-and above all the incessant tinkering named hum of industry-the hurrying to and fro and confused jabbering of men-Can man do less than get up and shake himself?</p>\n<p>April 24th 1838.</p>\n<p>Steam ships</p>\n<p>-Men have been contriving new means and modes of motion-Steam ships have been westering during these late days and nights on the Atlantic waves-the fuglers of a new evolution to this generation - - Meanwhile plants spring silently by the brook sides-and the grim woods wave indifferent-the earth emits no howl pot on fire simmers and seethes and men go about their business. - -</p>\n<p>Saturday March 19th 1842</p>\n<p>When I walk in the fields of Concord and meditate on the destiny of this prosperous slip of the Saxon <i>family</i>-the unexhausted energies of this new country-I forget that this which is now Concord was once Musketaquid and that the <i>American race</i> has had its destiny also. Everywhere in the fields-in the corn and grain land-the earth is strewn with the relics of a race which has vanished as completely as if trodden in with the earth.</p>\n<p>I find it good to remember the eternity behind me as well as the eternity before. Where ever I go I tread in the tracks of the Indian-I pick up the bolt which he has but just dropped at my feet. And if I consider destiny I am on his trail. I scatter his hearth stones with my feet, and pick out of the embers of his fire the simple but enduring implements of the wigwam and the chace-In planting my corn in the same furrow which yielded its increase to his support so long-I displace some memorial of him.</p>\n<p>I have been walking this afternoon over a pleasant field planted with winter rye-near the house. Where this strange people once had their dwelling place. Another species of mortal men but little less wild to me than the musquash they hunted-Strange spirits-daemons-whose eyes could never meet mine. With another nature-and another fate than mine- The crows flew over the edge of the woods, and wheeling over my head seemed to rebuke-as dark winged spirits more akin to the Indian than I. Perhaps only the present disguise of the Indian- If the new has a meaning so has the old.</p>\n<p>Nature has her russet hues as well as green-Indeed our eye splits on every object, and we can as well take one path as the other-If I consider its history it is old-if its destiny it is new-I may see a part of an object or the whole-I will not be imposed on and think nature is old, because the season is advanced I will study the botany of the mosses and fungi on the decayed-and remember that decayed wood is not old, but has just begun to be what it is. I need not think of the pine almond or the acorn and sapling when I meet the fallen pine or oak-more than of the generations of pines and oaks which have fed the young tree.</p>\n<p>The new blade of the corn-the third leaf of the melon-these are not green but gray with time, but sere in respect of time.</p>\n<p>September 12, 1851</p>\n<p>2 PM To the Three Friends' Hill beyond Flints Pond-via RR. RWEs Wood Path S side Walden-Geo Heywood's Cleared Lot &amp; Smith's orchards-return via E of Flints' P via Goose P &amp; my old home to RR-</p>\n<p>I go to Flints P. for the sake of the <i>Mt</i> view from the hill beyond looking over Concord. I have thought it the best especially in the winter which I can get in this neighborhood. It is worth the while to see the <i>Mts</i> in the horizon once a day. I have thus seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly &amp; trivial-to my most heaven-ward looking thoughts-The earth seen through an azure an etherial veil. They are the natural <i>temples</i> elevated brows of the earth-looking at which the thoughts of the beholder are naturally elevated and etherialized. I wish to see the earth through the medium of much air or heaven-for there is no paint like the air. <i>Mts</i> thus seen are worthy of worship. I go to Flints' Pond also to see a rippling lake &amp; a reedy-island in its midst-Reed Island.</p>\n<p>A man should feed his senses with the best that the land affords</p>\n<p>At the entrance to the Deep Cut I heard the telegraph wire vibrating like an AÆolian Harp. It reminded me suddenly-reservedly with a beautiful paucity of communication-even silently, such was its effect on my thoughts-It reminded me, I say, with a certain pathetic moderation-of what finer &amp; deeper stirrings I was susceptible-which grandly set all argument &amp; dispute aside- -a triumphant though transient exhibition of the truth. It told me by the faintest imaginable strain-it told me by the finest strain that a human ear can hear-yet conclusively &amp; past all refutation-that there were higher infinitely higher plains of life-which it behoved me never to forget. As I was entering the Deep Cut the wind which was conveying a message to me from heaven dropt it on the wire of the telegraph which it vibrated as it past. I instantly sat down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph pole-&amp; attended to the communication. It merely said \"Bear in mind, Child &amp; never for an instant forget-that there are higher plains infinitely higher plains of life than this thou art now travelling on. Know that the goal is distant &amp; is upward and is worthy all your life's efforts to attain to.\" And then it ceased and though I sat some minutes longer I heard nothing more.</p>\n<p>There is every variety &amp; degree of inspiration from mere fullness of life to the most rapt mood. A human soul is played on even as this wire-which now vibrates slowly &amp; gently so that the passer can hardly hear it &amp; anon the sound swells &amp; vibrates with such intensity as if it would rend the wire-as far as the elasticity &amp; tension of the wire permits-and now it dies away and is silent-&amp; though the breeze continues to sweep over it, no strain comes from it-&amp; the traveller hearkens in vain. It is no small gain to have this wire stretched through Concord though there may be no Office here. Thus I make my own use of the telegraph-without consulting the Directors-like the sparrows which I perceive use it extensively for a perch.</p>\n<p>Shall I not go to this office to hear if there is any communication for me-as steadily as to the Post office in the village?</p>\n<p>Tuesday Dec 30th</p>\n<p>Mem. Go to the Deep Cut. The flies now crawl forth from the crevices all covered with dust, dreaming of summer-without life or energy enough to clean their wings</p>\n<p>This afternoon being on fair Haven Hill I heard the sound of a saw-and soon after from the cliff saw two men sawing down a noble pine beneath about 40 rods off. I resolved to watch it till it fell-the last of a dozen or more which were left when the forest was cut and for 15 years have waved in solitary majesty over the sproutland. I saw them like beavers or insects gnawing at the trunk of this noble tree, the diminutive mannikins with their crosscut saw which could scarcely span it. It towered up a hundred feet as I afterward found by measurement-one of the tallest probably now in the township &amp; straight as an arrow, but slanting a little toward the hill side.-its top seen against the frozen river &amp; the hills of Conantum. I watch closely to see when it begins to move. Now the sawers stop-and with an axe open it a little on the side toward which it leans that it may break the faster. And now their saw goes again-Now surely it is going-it is inclined one quarter of the quadrant, and breathless I expect its crashing fall-But no I was mistaken it has not moved an inch, it stands at the same angle as at first. It is 15 minutes yet to its fall. Still its branches wave in the wind as if it were destined to stand for a century, and the wind soughs through its needles as of yore; it is still a forest tree-the most majestic tree that waves over Musketaquid.-The silvery sheen of the sunlight is reflected from its needles-it still affords an inaccessible crotch for the squirrel's nest not a lichen has forsaken its mastlike stem- -its raking mast-the hill is the hull. Now's the moment the mannikins at its base are fleeing from their crime-they have dropped the guilty saw &amp; axe. How slowly &amp; majestically it starts-as if it were only swayed by a summer breeze and would return without a sigh to its location in the air-&amp; now it fans the hill side with its fall and it lies down to its bed in the valley from which it is never to rise, as softly as a feather, folding its green mantle about it like a warrior-as if tired of standing it embraced the earth with silent joy.-returning its elements to the dust again-but hark! there you only saw-but did not hear-There now comes up a deafening crash to these rocks-advertising you that even trees do not die without a groan. It rushes to embrace the earth, &amp; mingle its elements with the dust. And now all is still once more &amp; forever both to eye &amp; ear.</p>\n<p>I went down and measured it. It was about 4 feet in diameter where it was sawed-about 100 feet long. Before I had reached it-the axe-men had already half divested it of its branches. Its gracefully spreading top was a perfect wreck on the hill side as if it had been made of glass-&amp; the tender cones of one years growth upon its summit appealed in vain &amp; too late to the mercy of the chopper. Already he has measured it with his axe-and marked out the mill logs it will make. And the space it occupied in upper air is vacant for the next 2 centuries. It is lumber He has laid waste the air. When the fish hawk in the spring revisits the banks of the Musketaquid, he will circle in vain to find his accustomed perch.-&amp; the henhawk will mourn for the pines lofty enough to protect her brood. A plant which it has taken two centuries to perfect rising by slow stages into the heavens-has this afternoon ceased to exist. Its sapling top had expanded to this January thaw as the forerunner of summers to come. Why does not the village bell sound a knell. I hear no knell tolled-I see no procession of mourners in the streets-or the woodland aisles-The squirrel has leapt to another tree-the hawk has circled further off-&amp; has now settled upon a new eyre but the woodman is preparing to lay his axe at the root of that also.</p>\n<p>Dec 31st</p>\n<p>The 3d warm day. now overcast and beginning to drizzle. Still it is inspiriting as the brightest weather though the sun surely is not agoing to shine. There is a latent light in the mist-as if there were more electricity than usual in the air. These are warm foggy days in winter which excite us.</p>\n<p>It reminds me this thick spring like weather, that 1 have not enough valued and attended to the pure clarity &amp; brilliancy of the winter skies-Consider in what respects the winter sunsets differ from the summer ones. Shall I ever in summer evenings see so celestial a reach of blue sky contrasting with amber as I have seen a few days since-The day sky in winter corresponds for clarity to the night sky in which the stars shine &amp; twinkle so brightly in this latitude.</p>\n<p>I am too late perhaps, to see the sand foliage in the deep cut-should have been there day before yesterday-it is now too wet &amp; soft.</p>\n<p><i>(Continues...)</i></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<blockquote><br>\n Excerpted from <b>AMERICAN EARTH</b> by <b>Bill McKibben</b> Copyright © 2008 by Literary Classics of the United States, New York, NY..

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Gregory McNamee</h4>What truly sets the anthology apart is not the mix of the obscure and the familiar but McKibben's habit of enlisting voices whom we are not accustomed to thinking of as environmentalists or ecologists. I'd be willing to bet that this is the first work of nature writing to feature the drawings of R. Crumb, of Zap Comix fame, alongside lyrics by Marvin Gaye…Well selected, full of surprises and informed by McKibben's thoughtful commentary, <i>American Earth</i> is the first anthology of American nature writing to come close to the standard Thomas Lyon set two decades ago with <i>\"This Incomperable Lande\": A Book of American Nature Writing.</i> Ours is an incomparable land indeed, and McKibben's collection is a welcome reminder.<br>\n—The Washington Post\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4><p>In his introduction to this superb anthology, McKibben (<i>The End of Nature</i>) proposes that \"environmental writing is America's most distinctive contribution to the world's literature.\" The collected pieces amply prove the point. Arranged chronologically, McKibben's selection of more than 100 writers includes some of the great early conservationists, such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and John Burroughs, and many other eloquent nature writers, including Donald Cultross Peattie, Edwin Way Teale and Henry Beston. The early exponents of national parks and wilderness areas have their say, as do writers who have borne witness to environmental degradation-John Steinbeck and Caroline Henderson on the dust bowl, for example, and Berton Roueché and others who have reported on the effects of toxic pollution. Visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and Amory Lovins are represented, as are a wealth of contemporary activist/writers, among them Barry Lopez, Terry Tempest Williams, Barbara Kingsolver, Michael Pollan, Paul Hawken, and Calvin deWitt, cofounder of the Evangelical Environmental Network. McKibben's trenchant introductions to the pieces sum up each writer's thoughts and form a running commentary on the progress of the conservation movement. The book, being published on Earth Day, can be read as a survey of the literature of American environmentalism, but above all, it should be enjoyed for the sheer beauty of the writing. 80-page color illus, not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Apr. 22 [Earth Day])</i></p>\nCopyright 2007 Reed Business Information\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4><p>Adult/High School- There have been some excellent collections of nature writing published in recent years (<i>The Norton Anthology of Nature Writing</i> is one fine example), but not until now has there been a definitive anthology of American environmental writing. In this superbly edited volume, McKibben draws a clear distinction between the two. The best of the latter often celebrates nature, but also asks searching questions about the impact of human life on the planet. After a poignant foreword by Al Gore, as well as his own illuminating introduction, McKibben begins with the work of a writer, thinker, and activist ahead of his time, Henry David Thoreau, and ends the volume with Rebecca Solnit's essay, \"The Thoreau Problem.\" She notes that many people think of Thoreau only as a man alone observing nature, but the author of \"Civil Disobedience,\" before enjoying his day of huckleberry picking, spent a night in jail rather than pay taxes to a government guilty of ignoring the higher laws of nature. This vast and varied collection, arranged chronologically, includes many seminal names, such as John Muir, Rachel Carson, and Wendell Berry, and some that are less well known or unexpected, like Benton MacKaye, Caroline Henderson, P. T. Barnum, and Philip K. Dick. Most of the selections derive from longer prose works, but there is also a smattering of poems, song lyrics, and cartoons. Although the heft of the volume might scare away some teens, others may realize that they could easily read bits and pieces, and that they would benefit greatly by any amount of time spent in these pages. Numerous photographs, many in full color, are included.-<i>Robert Saunderson, Berkeley Public Library,CA</i></p>\n\n\n</article>"

      "excerpt": "<b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost \n<h3>Chapter One</h3>\n<h4>The Art of Reading Poetry</h4>\n<p>Poetry essentially is figurative language, concentrated so that its form is both expressive and evocative. Figuration is a departure from the literal, and the form of a great poem itself can be a trope (\"turning\") or figure. A common dictionary equivalent for \"figurative language\" is \"metaphorical,\" but a metaphor actually is a highly specific figure, or turning from the literal. Kenneth Burke, a profound student of rhetoric, or the language of figures, distinguished four fundamental tropes: irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. As Burke tells us, irony commits those who employ it to issues of presence and absence, since they are saying one thing while meaning something so different that it can be the precise opposite. We learn to wince when Hamlet says: \"I humbly thank you\" or its equivalent, since the prince generally is neither humble nor grateful.</p>\n<p>We now commonly call synecdoche \"symbol,\" since the figurative substitution of a part for a whole also suggests that incompletion in which something within the poem stands for something outside it. Poets frequently identify more with one trope than with the others. Among major American poets, Robert Frost (despite his mass reputation) favors irony, while Walt Whitman is the great master of synecdoche.</p>\n<p>In metonymy, contiguity replaces resemblance, since the name or prime aspect of anything is sufficient to indicate it, provided it is near in space to what serves as substitute. Childe Roland, in Browning's remarkable monologue, is represented at the very end by the \"slug-horn\" ortrumpet upon which he dauntlessly blows: \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.\"</p>\n<p>Metaphor proper transfers the ordinary associations of one word to another, as when Hart Crane beautifully writes \"peonies with pony manes,\" enhancing his metaphor by the pun between \"peonies\" and \"pony.\" Or again Crane, most intensely metaphorical of poets, refers to the Brooklyn Bridge's curve as its \"leap,\" and then goes on to call the bridge both harp and altar.</p>\n<p>Figurations or tropes create meaning, which could not exist without them, and this making of meaning is largest in authentic poetry, where an excess or overflow emanates from figurative language, and brings about a condition of newness. Owen Barfield's <i>Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning</i> is one of the best guides to this process, when he traces part of the poetic history of the English word \"ruin.\"</p>\n<p>The Latin verb <i>ruo</i>, meaning \"rush\" or \"collapse,\" led to the substantive <i>ruina</i> for what had fallen. Chaucer, equally at home in French and English, helped to domesticate \"ruin\" as \"a falling\":</p>\n<blockquote>Min is the ruine of the highe halles,<br>\n The falling of the towers and of the walles.</blockquote>\n<p>One feels the chill of that, the voice being Saturn's or time's in \"The Knight's Tale.\" Chaucer's disciple Edmund Spenser, has the haunting line:</p>\n<blockquote>The old ruines of a broken tower</blockquote>\n<p>My last selection in this book is Hart Crane's magnificent death ode, \"The Broken Tower,\" in which Spenser's line reverberates. Barfield emphasizes Shakespeare's magnificence in the employment of \"ruin,\" citing \"Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang\" from Sonnet 73, and the description of Cleopatra's effect upon her lover: \"The noble ruin of her magic, Antony.\" I myself find even stronger the blind Gloucester's piercing outcry when he confronts the mad King Lear (IV, VI, 134135):</p>\n<blockquote>O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br>\n Shall so wear out to nought.</blockquote>\n<p>Once Barfield sets one searching, the figurative power of \"ruined\" seems endless. Worthy of Shakespeare himself is John Donne, in his \"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day,\" where love resurrects the poet to his ruin:</p>\n<blockquote>Study me then, you who shall lovers be<br>\n At the next world, that is, at the next spring:<br>\n For I am every dead thing,<br>\n In whom love wrought new alchemy.<br>\n For his art did express<br>\n A quintessence even from nothingness,<br>\n From dull privations, and lean emptiness<br>\n He ruined me, and I am re-begot<br>\n Of absence, darkness, death; things which are not.</blockquote>\n<p>Barfield invokes what he rightly calls Milton's \"terrific phrase\": \"Hell saw / Heaven ruining from Heaven,\" and then traces Wordsworth's allusive return to Milton. Rather than add further instances, I note Barfield's insight, that the figurative power of \"ruin\" depends upon restoring its original sense of <i>movement</i>, of rushing toward a collapse. One of the secrets of poetic rhetoric in English is to romance the etonym (as it were), to renew what Walter Pater called the \"finer edges\" of words.</p>\n<i><b>The Best Poems of the English Language</b><br>\nFrom Chaucer Through Robert Frost</i>.

Out of necessity, Giovanni admits she cheats a little, selecting a larger, less round number.</p>\n<p>The result is this startlingly vibrant collection that spans from historic to modern, from structured to freeform, and reflects the rich roots and visionary future of African American verse. These magnetic poems are an exciting mix of most-loved classics and daring new writing. From Gwendolyn Brooks and Langston Hughes to Tupac Shakur, Natasha Trethewey, and many others, the voice of a culture comes through in this collection, one that is as talented, diverse, and varied as its people.</p>\n<p>African American poems are like all other poems: beautiful, loving, provocative, thoughtful, and all those other adjectives I can think of. <i>Poems know no boundaries</i>. They, like all Earth citizens, were born in some country, grew up on some culture, then in their blooming became citizens of the Universe. <i>Poems fly from heart to heart</i>, head to head, to whisper a dream, to share a condolence, to congratulate, and to vow forever. The poems are true. They are translated and they are celebrated. They are sung, they are recited, they are <i>delightful</i>. They are neglected. They are forgotten. They are put away.

      "excerpt": "<p>From the Introduction:</p>\n<p>Poems are like clouds on a June morning or two scoops of chocolate ice cream on a sugar cone in August...something everyone can enjoy. Or maybe poems are your cold feet in December on your lover's back...he is in agony but he lets your feet stay...something like that requires a bit of love. Or could it be that poems are exactly like Santa Claus...the promise, the hope, the excitement of a reward, no matter how small, for a good deed done...or a mean deed from which we refrained. The promise of tomorrow. I don't know. It seems that poems are essential. Like football to Fall, baseball to Spring, tennis to Summer, love Anytime. Something you don't think too much about until it is in Season. Then you deliciously anticipate the perfection. African American poems are like all other poems: beautiful, loving, provocative, thoughtful, and all those other adjectives I can think of.</p>\n<p>Poems know no boundaries. They, like all Earth citizens, were born in some country, grew up on some culture, then in their blooming became citizens of the Universe. Poems fly from heart to heart, head to head, to whisper a dream, to share a condolence, to congratulate, and to vow forever. The poems are true. They are translated and they are celebrated. They are sung, they are recited, they are delightful. They are neglected. They are forgotten. They are put away. Even in their fallow periods they sprout images. And fight to be revived. And spring back to life with a bit of sunshine and caring.</p>\n<p>These poems, this book, admit I cheated. The idea of <i>this</i> and no more would simply not work for me. I needed <i>these</i> plus <i>those</i>. My mother's favorite poem by Robert Hayden, plus James Weldon Johnson beginning a world that included the longing of the unfree for a loving God. My own fun \"Ego Tripping\" reaching to embrace Margaret Walker's \"For My People.\" \"Train Rides\" and \"Nikki-Rosa\" read by old and loving friends. But also the newness: Novella Nelson lending that sultry voice to the youngsters; Ruby Dee bringing her brilliance to the Gwendolyn Brooks cycle. My Virginia Tech Family wanted to participate: our president Dr. Charles Steger reading \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,\" recognizing all our souls \"have grown deep like the rivers.\" We celebrate our Hips; we See A Negro Lady at a birthday celebration. Our friends from James Madison University and West Virginia University came to celebrate poetry with us, too. I love these poems so much. The only other thing I would have loved is Caroline Kennedy reading \"A Clean Slate.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of a loving day of laughter in Jeff Dalton's studio, when Clinton's makeup had taken forty years off some of us and twenty-five off others, we all came together with one last great cry: the Dean of our College; the Director of Honors; young, old, professional, professor, and recited in one great voice \"We Real Cool.\" Yeah. We are. This book says Poetry Is For Everyone. What a Treat to be Snowbound with <i>The 100* Best African American Poems (*but I cheated)</i>.</p>\n<p>I did cheat.<br>\n It's true.<br>\n But I did not lie.</p>\n<p>Nikki Giovanni Poet<br>\n 12 December 2009</p>",

Selections are from America's greatest and most representative poets: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes. Though one may cavil at particular omissions or inclusions, especially the practice of excerpting Whitman's ``Song of Myself,'' Conarroe's anthology is a superb introduction to the pleasures of poetry for the general reader. The fine introduction and prefaces provide added assistance to those who, starting here, will doubtlessly want to continue ex ploring poetry. Highly recommended. BOMC selection.-- Frank J.

      "excerpt": "<b>ROBERT FROST (1875-1963)</b>\n<p>Born in San Francisco, Frost moved to New England ten years later upon the death of his father, and in effect remained there the rest of his life, becoming the New Englander par excellence of his age. Yet his early life was not notably successful. Twice interrupted in attempts to secure a college degree, he farmed for a while in New Hampshire, worked as a mill hand, a schoolteacher, a newspaperman. His first poem was published in 1894; but during the next twenty years his work was consistently rejected by American editors.</p>\n<p>Finally, discouraged but still determined, Frost went to England in 1912, and there won the support of influential poets and critics, including Ezra Pound. His first two books, <b>A Boy's Will</b> (1913) and <b>North of Boston</b> (1914), were published in London. In 1915 he returned to America. Thereafter his success was unquestioned: he won many honors, including four Pulitzer Prizes for poetry, and became not only the most popular serious poet in the country but one of the most generally respected among fellow writers. Frost's poetic practice was based on what he called \"sentence sounds,\" the natural tones and rhythms of speech cast loosely against standard poetic forms. Conventional as it may seem today, it was a new departure in its time, making Frost a distinctly modern poet. Similarly his combination of Emersonian spiritual aspiration with back-country Yankee pragmatism placed him squarely among his contemporaries, to whom his metaphysically probing Iyrics and narratives, sometimes cynical or playful but often genuinely anguished, spoke with force. These factors, together with his superb poetic gift, make him dominant in the American tradition, a figure with whom younger poets, even the most rebellious, must come to terms.</p>\n<p><b>Complete Poems of Robert Frost</b>.

The gaps I mean,<br>\nNo one has seen them made or heard them made,<br>\nBut at spring mending-time we find them there.<br>\nI let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>\nAnd on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again.<br>\nWe keep the wall between us as we go.<br>\nTo each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br>\nAnd some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br>\n'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'<br>\nWe wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br>\nOh, just another kind of outdoor game,<br>\nOne on a side. It comes to little more:<br>\nThere where it is we do not need the wall:<br>\nHe is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br>\nMy apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br>\nHe only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'<br>\nSpring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head:<br>\n<i>'Why</i> do they make good neighbors? Isn't it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br>\nBefore I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out,<br>\nAnd to whom I was like to give offense.<br>\nSomething there is that doesn't love a wall That wants it down.' I could say 'E1ves' to him,<br>\nBut it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself. I see him there Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br>\nHe moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br>\nNot of woods only and the shade of trees.<br>\nHe will not go behind his father's saying,<br>\nAnd he likes having thought of it so well He says again, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">CARL SANDBURG (1878-1967)</p>\n<p>The son of Swedish immigrants, Sandburg grew up in Galesburg, Ill., a railroad town, where he attended school until he was thirteen, then dropped out and wandered for years through the West and Midwest, working at varied jobs. He served in the Spanish-American War and for a while attended college. Finally he settled in Milwaukee, where he married, became a Socialist and a newspaperman, and began devoting himself seriously to poetry. In 1913 he moved to Chicago. Harriet Monroe, founder of <i>Poetry,</i> gave his work a prominent place in her magazine, where it attracted attention for its robust and Whitmanesque freedom. Two books, <b>Chicago Poetry</b> (1916) and <b>Cornhuskers</b> (1918), assured his reputation. During the twenties and thirties Sandburg toured widely, lecturing, reading his poems, singing and collecting folk songs, playing his guitar. His two collections, <b>The American Songbag</b> (1927) and <b>The New American Songbag</b> (1950), are important contributions to folklore. At the same time he became deeply interested in the life and achievement of Abraham Lincoln, and spent many years in producing a multi-volume biography. In addition his works include several first-rate books for children (the Rootabaga series), novels, autobiographies, screen plays, and much journalism. Sandburg's poetry was scorned during his middle and later life by the European-oriented critics of the time, and in part rightly so; he wrote too much and too facilely. But some of his early poems have a fresh vision and incantatory vigor that remain firm. In style, attitude, and temperament, he was closer to the young poets of today than most of them recognize.</p>\n<p><b>Complete Poems</b>.

The course he chose would have seemed paradoxical to many, but not to him. He studied law, entered the insurance business at Hartford, Conn., and spent a number of years working upward to an executive position and a life of affluence. Consequently his first book, <b>Harmonium</b> (1923), did not appear until he was forty-three years old; but then it made an immediate hit. Many of its poems became favorites: \"Hibiscus on the Sleeping Shores,\" \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The Emperor of Ice-Cream,\" \"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon,\" \"Sea Surface Full of Clouds,\" etc. They were as exotic as their titles; full of tropical imagery and unusual diction, armored in brilliant stylized rhetoric; but despite their ornamentation they dealt with disturbing themes, particularly man's attempt to find, or create, meaning in a universe from which the spiritual rationale had apparently departed. For Stevens, the way lay through aesthetic experience; yet he was never merely willing to substitute art for reality. The real world, he insisted, was the \"necessary angel\" who announced to imaginative man the plenitude of hie. As his books succeeded one another, perceptive readers saw that although the famous stylization of the early poems had moderated, the new work was more exact, better integrated, and more profoundly felt. Indeed some of Stevens's most moving poems, written in his last years, were not published until after his death, in a volume which also contains bis \"Adagia\", brilliant prose aphorisms and philosophical aperçus. No other poetry of the twentieth century has been more consistently, flawlessly individual; none has been more attractive; none has been harder to imitate. Hence the influence of Stevens on younger poets, though pervasive, has been indirect.</p>\n<p><b>The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens</b>. Knopf, 1954.<br>\n<b>Opus Posthumous</b>. Ed.

      "excerpt": "<p>I told the listeners that I was looking for stories. The stories had to be true, and they had to be short, but there would be no restrictions as to subject matter or style. What interested me most, I said, were stories that defied our expectations of the world, anecdotes that revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives, in our family histories, in our minds and bodies, in our souls . . . I was hoping to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality.</p>\n<p>More than ever, I have come to appreciate how deeply and passionately most of us live within ourselves. Our attachments are ferocious. Our loves overwhelm us, define us, obliterate the boundaries between ourselves and others. —from the Prologue</p>\n<p>So there was Mr. Bernhauser yelling at us to get the hell out of his tree, and my father asked him what the problem was. Mr. Bernhauser took a deep breath and launched into a diatribe about thieving kids, breakers of rules, takers of fruit, and monsters in general. I guess my father had had enough, for the next thing he did was shout at Mr. Bernhauser and tell him to drop dead. Mr. Bernhauser stopped screaming, looked at my father, turned bright red, then purple, grabbed his chest, turned gray, and slowly folded to the ground. I thought my father was God. That he could yell at a miserable old man and make him die on command was beyond my comprehension. —Robert Winnie Bonners Ferry, Idaho</p>",

There is the unassuming yet beautiful portrait of a summer afternoon in a 1960s Manhattan neighborhood; the story of a man given leave after fifteen years in prison to attend his grandmother's funeral; and a homeless woman's account of her living situation. There are impossible coincidences, eerie omens and visions, and tales of love and war and family and death. <BR> Ted Waitt <BR> <BR></p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Famed author Paul Auster presents 180 of the \"true tales\" from National Public Radio's monthly National Story Project series. The vividly personal biographies come from men and women of every conceivable background and cover more than 40 U.S. states. The accounts are short but powerful; they include everything from amusing misunderstandings to heartbreakingly tragic moments. The result is nothing less than what Auster himself describes as \"an archive of facts, a museum of American reality.\"\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4><p>“A powerful book, one in which strangers share with you their darkest secrets, their happiest memories, their fears, their regrets. To read these essays is to look into hearts, to see life from other viewpoints, to live vicariously.” —<i>The Boston Globe</i></p>\n<p>“Unforgettable testimonials of human resilience. Moving and amusing dispatches from across America.” —<i>Us Weekly</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“Human foibles and frailties, laughter and tears...We are all hearing—and telling—stories all the time, especially now, in these days when life itself seems so fragile and precious. But Paul Auster’s wonderful efforts, choosing these fine stories, have given us a timely and invaluable reminder of what it means to listen—to really listen—to America talking.” —<i>The Times-Picayune</i> (New Orleans)</p>\n<p>“Finally, a bathroom book worthy of Pulitzer consideration: the one-to-three-page stories gathered in this astonishing, addictive collection are absolute gems.” —<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“It is difficult to think of another book published this year, and probably any book to be published next year, that is so simple and so obvious, so excellent in intention and so elegant in its execution, and which displays such wisdom and such knowledge of human life in all its varieties. It is also difficult to think of a book that is so stark a reminder that human experience can be horrid and utterly unbelievable, and which therefore answers so precisely to our current needs and circumstances.”—<i>The Guardian</i> (UK)</p>\n<p>“As this collection ably proves, we all shape experience into stories, and Auster has done a storyteller’s job himself of grouping these pieces effectively. Highly recommended.” —<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</p>\n<p>“Like no other book I have read in years, this one restored my belief in Americans and the American experience.” —Philip Levine, <i>Ploughshares</i></p>\n\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>From The Critics</h4>Two years ago, on National Public Radio's \"Weekend All Things Considered,\" Auster introduced the National Story Project. In an attempt \"to put together an archive of facts, a museum of American reality,\" he welcomed anyone to submit a story, following two rules: it must be true and it must be short. This book collects 179 stories-Auster calls them \"reports from the frontlines of personal experience\"-picked from over 4,000 entries. There is the unassuming yet beautiful portrait of a summer afternoon in a 1960s Manhattan neighborhood; the story of a man given leave after fifteen years in prison to attend his grandmother's funeral; and a homeless woman's account of her living situation. There are impossible coincidences, eerie omens and visions, and tales of love and war and family and death. <br>\n—Ted Waitt <br>\n <br>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>This is a moving collection of stories that realizes the audio format's best possibilities. Culled from a collaboration between novelist Auster (Leviathan) and National Public Radio's All Things Considered, these slices of the American experience are real-life tales from people all over the country on a range of subjects. Since Auster himself selected the stories, it's no surprise that they echo his own approach while reading them: comfortable and emotive, with dexterous use of the power of understatement. Auster's tone is engaging, if a bit mellow, but what comes across more than anything is his genuine concern for the stories themselves and his belief in their merits. He keeps his dramatization to a minimum in order to let those merits shine through, and the recording is sure to leave listeners alternately smiling, nostalgic or melancholic. Even if a particular piece doesn't strike a chord, listeners won't be disappointed for long, as one of the production's finer points is its variety. Each tale lasts only a few minutes, but many of the images linger much longer. And because the stories were originally intended for radio, this is one instance where the audio is preferred over the print version. Based on the Holt hardcover (Forecasts, June 4, 2001). (Sept.) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>In 2001, when NPR asked Auster to become a regular storyteller on Weekend All Things Considered, he wasn't interested. Then his wife suggested that he ask people to send him their stories to read on the air, and a few months later the National Story Project with was born. From some 4000 stories, Auster has selected 179, grouping them in loose categories: animals, objects, families, slapstick, strangers, war, love, death, dreams, and meditations. All are short, all are true, and they can be sad, hilarious, or both at the same time. In the title piece, Robert Winnie's father tells someone to drop dead and he does! In another, a grandson who has made his grandmother furious hears his grandfather tell him, \"You are my revenge.\" Others tell of impossible coincidences, difficult lives, and wonderful comebacks. As this collection ably proves, we all shape experience into stories, and Auster has done a storyteller's job himself of grouping the pieces effectively. Highly recommended for public libraries. [Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 5/1/01.] Mary Paumier Jones, Westminster P.L., Westminster, CO Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>Adult/High School-Auster was on the verge of saying no to an offer to tell his own stories on the air when a chance remark by his wife changed the complexion and ultimately the direction of a National Public Radio project. She suggested that listeners be invited to make submissions. With that, the remarkable National Story Project was born. The rules were relatively simple; the stories had to be true and they had to be short. Four thousand people sent in their work. After just a few months, it became evident to Auster that too many good stories were coming in and that a book would be necessary to do justice to the project. He chose what he considered to be the best-179 pieces, written by individuals ranging in age from 20 to 90, from all walks of life, and touching on everything from the amazing to the poignant. Readers will turn pages to see if the next story is just as memorable as the one before, and it is. This is a wonderful book about some incredible people, to enjoy and to share with others.-Peggy Bercher, Fairfax County Public Library, VA Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>A collection of vignettes from the American stew pot, written for broadcast on National Public Radio by men and women from every racial, cultural, and economic stratum. Auster, who proposed the National Story Project in 1999 and has been reading the results on NPR ever since, has received more than 4,000 submissions since the project began. He culled 179 of them for this volume, few more than two or three pages long, some as brief as half a page. Placing no limits on subject matter, Auster asked his listeners only for anecdotes that \"revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives.\" What he got were tales ranging from spectral apparitions in the bedroom to painful custody trials, with a preponderant emphasis on childhood memories. The collection he shaped from this material encompasses the comic and the tragic, the absurd and the surreal, the mundane and the ethereal. The title story, for instance, recounts a bizarre incident from the writer's youth, when his father in a burst of justifiable irritation told a cranky neighbor to \"drop dead\"-and the neighbor did. \"The Chicken,\" which opens the collection, is a provocative six-sentence tale about a bird's adventure on the streets of Portland, Oregon. The volume is divided somewhat arbitrarily into 10 chapters, beginning with \"Animals\" and concluding with \"Meditations\"; \"War,\" \"Death,\" \"Love,\" and \"Slapstick\" fall in between. The prose can be awkward, pretentious, or occasionally elegant, but for the most part it's simple and direct. \"A Shot in the Light,\" for instance, relates the story of a man who was shot four times by a stranded motorist he had befriended. Victim and shooter survive, and the piece shows forgivenesson both sides, but the author makes no attempt to relate the incident to larger religious or political themes. Bedside fodder for general readers and a bonanza for fiction writers looking for core stories to launch a novel.

      "overview": "A best-selling anthology since its first edition, this premier survey of American literature has influenced the manner in which the American literary canon is taught in classrooms across the nation. In response to readers' requests, the editors of the <i>Heath Anthology</i> continue to develop and reinforce its greatest strengths: diverse reading selections and strong ancillaries. With the assistance of more than 200 contributing editors all specialists in particular eras and writers the editors have updated biographical and critical information, as well as added new works of interest to both instructors and students.<br>\n<br>\n<p>The Fourth Edition features writers and selections that highlight the divergent communities and diverse voices constituting the United States, both past and present. Volume 1 takes students from Native American oral literatures up to 1865, including Whitman and Dickinson. Volume 2 (which can be packaged with a free supplement of Whitman and Dickinson works) opens with African American folk tales and regional writers, and includes new sections on the Beat Movement and the Vietnam Conflict.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-length texts continue to be integrated throughout the anthology, including <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> in Vol. 1 and <i>The Awakening</i> in Vol. 2.</li>\n<li>The textbook web site complements both volumes of the text through a searchable, multimedia timeline with literary, historical, and cultural information; author profile pages; links to other sites for further research; and an online version of the Instructor's Guide.</li>\n<li>The Southern literature section includes two short stories by William Faulkner, Dry September and Barn Burning, and an essay by H.L. Mencken, TheSahara of the Bozarts. Coverage of border literature includes the work of novelist María Amparo Ruíz de Burton. In addition, gay and lesbian writers such as Dorothy Allison, James Merrill, and Richard Rodriguez are featured throughout.</li>\n</ul>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From the Publisher</h4>\"Anthologies of Latino literature abound, and rightly so, but most focus on contemporary authors. Augenbraum and Olmos dig deeper, tracing the roots of this vibrant literary tradition all the way back to the mid-sixteenth century. They have selected strikingly effective works of history, memoirs, letters, essays, poetry, drama, and fiction, including texts translated into English for the first time, creating a broad range of voices and perspectives. The volume begins with Alva Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Account, a chronicle of a disastrous 1527 expedition in the Southwest that is emblematic of all encounters between Spanish conquistadores and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This powerful piece serves as the anthology's overture, and establishes Latino literature's key cultural and political themes. Other compelling and enlightening offerings include works by William Carlos Williams, a poet whose Puerto Rican heritage has rarely been considered integral to his poetic innovations; novelist John Rechy; Cleofas Jaramillo, a descendent of hispano pioneers; and a host of remarkable Latino writers prominent in decades past but overlooked in recent compilations.\" Booklist, ALA\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>The compilers, scholars who have studied and written about the Latino population in the United States, have put together an anthology of literary works dealing with the panorama of Latino writings in the United States.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>No pleasures are more aesthetic than poetry and nature, so it is only natural that the two should unite. Editor Dungy here merges the worlds in a satisfying compilation that features over 100 poems by 93 African American poets, including celebrated writers June Jordan and Yusef Komunyakaa as well as newer artists like Remica L. Bingham and Indigo Moor. The collection, which is assembled in cycles that beg \"Nature, Be with Us,\" recognizes \"Pest, People Too,\" and recalls \"What the Land Remembers,\" explores a multitude of themes that incorporate the beauty, transformation, and unpredictability of Earth's elements. Though the collection moves away from political and protest poetry, readers will likely appreciate \"Disasters, Natural and Other,\" as the section draws from familiar incidents. James A. Emanuel's \"Emmett Till\" paints a haunting yet wondrous fantasy of his spirit, while Douglas Kearney's historical \"Floodsong 2: Water Moccasin's Spiritual\" has contemporary relevance following Hurricane Katrina. VERDICT Expanding the realm of traditional nature poetry and African American writings, this work will appeal to readers of both genres.—Ashanti White, Univ. of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\n</article>"

      "excerpt": "<b>Chapter One: Washington Irving</b>\n<p><i>Washington Irving (1783-1859), America's first successful man of letters, now known primarily for his Hudson Valley tales \"Rip Van Winkle\" and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" made his initial splash at age twenty-six with a comic, mock-learned, rambling volume, whose full title</i>, A History of New York From the Beginnings of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, <i>indicates the tongue-in-cheek, mythological manner in which Irving clothed his account of his native city's roots. The book pretended to have been written by an aged, bitter codger of Dutch extraction, Diedrich Knickerbocker -- in short, one of history's \"losers.\" Thus began the whole \"Knickerbocker\" tradition, connecting that pseudonym with the city's local legends. Though A History of New York certainly has passages of farce and satire, Irving (who did considerable research) often followed historical events fairly closely. In any case, this first published history of the city attempted to provide the amnesiac, hustling, nineteenth-century port with a founding myth and a past. Its ironic, disenchanted voice set the tone for much New York literature to come.</i></p>\n<p>From <i>A History of New York</i></p>\n<p>The island of Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan, having been discovered, as was related in the last chapter; and being unanimously pronounced by the discoverers, the fairest spot in the known world, whereon to build a city, that should surpass all the emporiums of Europe, they immediately returned to Communipaw with the pleasing intelligence. Upon this a considerable colony was forthwith fitted out, who after a prosperous voyage of half an hour,arrived at Manna hata, and having previously purchased the land of the Indians, (a measure almost unparalleled in the annals of discovery and colonization) they settled upon the south-west point of the island, and fortified themselves strongly, by throwing up a mud battery, which they named FORT AMSTERDAM. A number of huts soon sprung up in the neighbourhood, to protect which, they made an enclosure of strong pallisadoes. A creek running from the East river, through what at present is called Whitehall street, and a little inlet from Hudson river to the bowling green formed the original boundaries; as though nature had kindly designated the cradle, in which the embryo of this renowned city was to be nestled. The woods on both sides of the creek were carefully cleared away, as well as from the space of ground now occupied by the bowling green. -- These precautions were taken to protect the fort from either the open attacks or insidious advances of its savage neighbours, who wandered in hordes about the forests and swamps that extended over those tracts of country, at present called broad way, Wall street, William street and Pearl street.</p>\n<p>No sooner was the colony once planted, than like a luxuriant vine, it took root and throve amazingly; for it would seem, that this thrice favoured island is like a munificent dung hill, where every thing finds kindly nourishment, and soon shoots up and expands to greatness. The thriving state of the settlement, and the astonishing encrease of houses, gradually awakened the leaders from a profound lethargy, into which they had fallen, after having built their mud fort. They began to think it was high time some plan should be devised, on which the encreasing town should be built; so taking pipe in mouth, and meeting in close divan, they forthwith fell into a profound deliberation on the subject.</p>\n<p>At the very outset of the business, an unexpected difference of opinion arose, and I mention it with regret, as being the first internal altercation on record among the new settlers. An ingenious plan was proposed by Mynheer Ten Broek to cut up and intersect the ground by means of canals; after the manner of the most admired cities in Holland; but to this Mynheer Hardenbroek was diametrically opposed; suggesting in place thereof, that they should run out docks and wharves, by means of piles driven into the bottom of the river, on which the town should be built -- By this means said he triumphantly, shall we rescue a considerable space of territory from these immense rivers, and build a city that shall rival Amsterdam, Venice, or any amphibious city in Europe. To this proposition, Ten Broek (or Ten breeches) replied, with a look of as much scorn as he could possibly assume. He cast the utmost censure upon the plan of his antagonist, as being preposterous, and against the very order of things, as he would leave to every true hollander. \"For what,\" said he, \"is a town without canals? -- it is like a body without veins and arteries, and must perish for want of a free circulation of the vital fluid\" -- Tough breeches, on the contrary, retorted with a sarcasm upon his antagonist, who was somewhat of an arid, dry boned habit of body; he remarked that as to the circulation of the blood being necessary to existence, Mynheer Ten breeches was a living contradiction to his own assertion; for every body knew there had not a drop of blood circulated through his wind dried carcass for good ten years, and yet there was not a greater busy body in the whole colony. Personalities have seldom much effect in making converts in argument -- nor have I ever seen a man convinced of error, by being convicted of deformity. At least such was not the case at present. Ten Breeches was very acrimonious in reply, and Tough Breeches, who was a sturdy little man, and never gave up the last word, rejoined with encreasing spirit -- Ten Breeches had the advantage of the greatest volubility, but Tough Breeches had that invaluable coat of mail in argument called obstinacy -- Ten Breeches had, therefore, the most mettle, but Tough Breeches the best bottom -- so that though Ten Breeches made a dreadful clattering about his ears, and battered and belaboured him with hard words and sound arguments, yet Tough Breeches hung on most resolutely to the last. They parted therefore, as is usual in all arguments where both parties are in the right, without coming to any conclusion -- but they hated each other most heartily forever after, and a similar breach with that between the houses of Capulet and Montague, had well nigh ensued between the families of Ten Breeches and Tough Breeches.</p>\n<p>I would not fatigue my reader with these dull matters of fact, but that my duty as a faithful historian, requires that I should be particular -- and in truth, as I am now treating of the critical period, when our city, like a young twig, first received the twists and turns, that have since contributed to give it the present picturesque irregularity for which it is celebrated, I cannot be too minute in detailing their first causes.</p>\n<p>After the unhappy altercation I have just mentioned, I do not find that any thing further was said on the subject, worthy of being recorded. The council, consisting of the largest and oldest heads in the community, met regularly once a week, to ponder on this momentous subject. -- But either they were deterred by the war of words they had witnessed, or they were naturally averse to the exercise of the tongue, and the consequent exercise of the brains -- certain it is, the most profound silence was maintained -- the question as usual lay on the table -- the members quietly smoked their pipes, making but few laws, without ever enforcing any, and in the mean time the affairs of the settlement went on -- as it pleased God.</p>\n<p>As most of the council were but little skilled in the mystery of combining pot hooks and hangers, they determined most judiciously not to puzzle either themselves or posterity, with voluminous records. The secretary however, kept the minutes of each meeting with tolerable precision, in a large vellum folio, fastened with massy brass clasps, with a sight of which I have been politely favoured by my highly respected friends, the Goelets, who have this invaluable relique, at present in their possession. On perusal, however, I do not find much information -- The journal of each meeting consists but of two lines, stating in dutch, that, \"the council sat this day, and smoked twelve pipes, on the affairs of the colony.\" -- By which it appears that the first settlers did not regulate their time by hours, but pipes, in the same manner as they measure distances in Holland at this very time; an admirably exact measurement, as a pipe in the mouth of a genuine dutchman is never liable to those accidents and irregularities, that are continually putting our clocks out of order.</p>\n<p>In this manner did the profound council of NEW AMSTERDAM smoke, and doze, and ponder, from week to week, month to month, and year to year, in what manner they should construct their infant settlement -- mean while, the town took care of itself, and like a sturdy brat which is suffered to run about wild, unshackled by clouts and bandages, and other abominations by which your notable nurses and sage old women cripple and disfigure the children of men, encreased so rapidly in strength and magnitude, that before the honest burgomasters had determined upon a plan, it was too late to put it in execution -- whereupon they wisely abandoned the subject altogether.</p>\n<p>Grievous, and very much to be commiserated, is the task of the feeling historian, who writes the history of his native land. If it falls to his lot to be the sad recorder of calamity or crime, the mournful page is watered with his tears -- nor can he recal the most prosperous and blissful eras, without a melancholy sigh at the reflection, that they have passed away forever! I know not whether it be owing to an immoderate love for the simplicity of former times, or to a certain tenderness of heart, natural to a sentimental historian; but I candidly confess, I cannot look back on the halcyon days of the city, which I now describe, without a deep dejection of the spirits. With faultering hand I withdraw the curtain of oblivion, which veils the modest merits of our venerable dutch ancestors, and as their revered figures rise to my mental vision, humble myself before the mighty shades.</p>\n<p>Such too are my feelings when I revisit the family mansion of the Knickerbockers and spend a lonely hour in the attic chamber, where hang the portraits of my forefathers, shrowded in dust like the forms they represent. With pious reverence do I gaze on the countenances of those renowned burghers, who have preceded me in the steady march of existence -- whose sober and temperate blood now meanders through my veins, flowing slower and slower in its feeble conduits, until its lingering current shall soon be stopped forever!</p>\n<p>These, say I to myself, are but frail memorials of the mighty men, who flourished in the days of the patriarchs; but who, alas, have long since mouldered in that tomb, towards which my steps are insensibly and irresistibly hastening! As I pace the darkened chamber and lose myself in melancholy musings, the shadowy images around me, almost seem to steal once more into existence -- their countenances appear for an instant to assume the animation of life -- their eyes to pursue me in every movement! carried away by the delusion of fancy, I almost imagine myself surrounded by the shades of the departed, and holding sweet converse with the worthies of antiquity!</p>\n<p>-- Luckless Diedrich! born in a degenerate age -- abandoned to the buffettings of fortune -- a stranger and a weary pilgrim in thy native land; blest with no weeping wife, nor family of helpless children -- but doomed to wander neglected through those crowded streets, and elbowed by foreign upstarts from those fair abodes, where once thine ancestors held sovereign empire. Alas! alas! is then the dutch spirit forever extinct? The days of the patriarchs, have they fled forever? Return -- return sweet days of simplicity and ease -- dawn once more on the lovely island of Manna hata! -- Bear with me my worthy readers, bear with the weakness of my nature -- or rather let us sit down together, indulge the full flow of filial piety, and weep over the memories of our great great grand-fathers.</p>\n<p>Having thus gratified those feelings irresistibly awakened by the happy scenes I am describing, I return with more composure to my history.</p>\n<p>The town of New Amsterdam, being, as I before mentioned, left to its own course and the fostering care of providence, increased as rapidly in importance, as though it had been burthened with a dozen panniers full of those sage laws, which are usually heaped upon the backs of young cities -- in order to make them grow. The only measure that remains on record of the worthy council, was to build a chapel within the fort, which they dedicated to the great and good St. Nicholas, who immediately took the infant town of New Amsterdam under his peculiar patronage, and has ever since been, and I devoutly hope will ever be, the tutelar saint of this excellent city. I am moreover told, that there is a little legendary book somewhere extant, written in low dutch, which says that the image of this renowned saint, which whilome graced the bowsprit of the Goede Vrouw, was placed in front of this chapel; and the legend further treats of divers miracles wrought by the mighty pipe which the saint held in his mouth; a whiff of which was a sovereign cure for an indigestion, and consequently of great importance in this colony of huge feeders. But as, notwithstanding the most diligent search, I cannot lay my hands upon this little book, I entertain considerable doubt on the subject.</p>\n<p>This much is certain, that from the time of the building of this chapel, the town throve with tenfold prosperity, and soon became the metropolis of numerous settlements, and an extensive territory. The province extended on the north, to Fort Aurania or Orange, now known by the name of Albany, situated about 160 miles up the Mohegan or Hudson River. Indeed the province claimed quite to the river St. Lawrence; but this claim was not much insisted on at the time, as the country beyond Fort Aurania was a perfect wilderness, reported to be inhabited by cannibals, and termed Terra Incognita. Various accounts were given of the people of these unknown parts; by some they are described as being of the race of the <i>Acephali,</i> such as Herodotus describes, who have no heads, and carry their eyes in their bellies. Others affirm they were of that race whom father Charlevoix mentions, as having but one leg; adding gravely, that they were exceedingly alert in running. But the most satisfactory account is that given by the reverend Hans Megapolensis, a missionary in these parts, who, in a letter still extant, declares them to be the Mohagues or Mohawks; a nation, according to his description, very loose in their morals, but withal most rare wags. \"For,\" says he, \"if theye can get to bedd with another mans wife, theye thinke it a piece of wit.\" This excellent old gentleman gives moreover very important additional information, about this country of monsters; for he observes, \"theye have plenty of tortoises here, and within land, from two and three to four feet long; some with two heads, very mischievous and addicted to biting.\"</p>\n<p>Copyright © 1998 by Literary Classics of the United States, Inc.<br>\n<br>\n </p>",

      "overview": "<p>Award-winning poet David Wagoner and renowned editor David Lehman present the twenty-second edition of the <i>Best American Poetry</i> series—\"a ‘best’ anthology that really lives up to its title\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).</p>\n<p>Eagerly anticipated by scholars, students, readers, and poets alike, Scribner’s <i>Best American Poetry</i> series has achieved brand-name status in the literary world, serving as a yearly guide to who’s who in American poetry. Known for his marvelous narrative skill and humane wit, David Wagoner is one of the few poets of his generation to win the universal admiration of his peers. Working in conjunction with series editor David Lehman, Wagoner brings his refreshing eye to this year’s anthology. With new work by established poets, such as Billy Collins, Denise Duhamel, Mark Doty, and Bob Hicok, <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i> also features some of tomorrow’s leading luminaries. Readers of all ages and backgrounds will treasure this illuminating collection of modern American verse.</p>\n<p>With its high-profile editorship and its generous embrace of American poetry in all its exuberant variety, the <i>Best American Poetry</i> series continues to be, as Robert Pinsky says, \"as good a comprehensive overview of contemporary poetry as there can be.\"</p>",
      "excerpt": "<br>\n<b><big>Foreword</big></b><br>\n<b><i>by David Lehman</i></b><br>\n<p>What is a poet? In his \"Defense of Poetry,\" Shelley writes, \"A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.\" The solitude and sweet darkness, the emphasis on the unseen, the nightingale as the image of the poet, the listeners entranced but bewildered: how romantic this formulation is -- and how well it fits its author. Matthew Arnold alters the metaphor but retains something of its tone when he calls Shelley \"a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain.\" Kierkegaard in <i>Either/Or</i> goes further than either Shelley or Arnold in accentuating the negative. In a passage I've long admired, Kierkegaard identifies the poet as one whose heart is full of anguish but whose lips transform all sighs and groans into beautiful music. Kierkegaard likens the fate of this \"unhappy\" individual to the cruel and unusual punishment meted out by the tyrant Phalaris, whose unfortunate victims, \"slowly roasted by a gentle fire\" in a huge copper bull, let out shrieks that turn into sweet melodies by the time they reach the tyrant's ears. The success of the poet, then, corresponds to the amount of agony endured. Readers clamor for more, for they are aware only of the music and not of the suffering that went into it. The critics, too, stand ready to applaud -- if, that is, the poet's work meets the requirements of the immutable \"laws of aesthetics.\" And here Kierkegaard's parable acquires an extra layer of irony, the better to convey his contempt for critics. \"Why, to be sure,\" he writes, \"a critic resembles a poet as one pea another, the only difference being that he has no anguish in his heart and no music on his lips.\" And therefore, Kierkegaard concludes with a flourish, sooner would he be a swineherd understood by the swine than a poet misunderstood by men.</p>\n<p>Kierkegaard's argument proceeds by the logic of his similes -- the sweet music, the barbaric torture, the prosaic peas in the pod, the swineherd as an honorable profession -- and the abrupt tonal shift at the end from sarcasm to defiance. If, as Wallace Stevens asserted, \"poetry is almost incredibly one of the effects of analogy,\" here is a gorgeous example. The passage has the virtue, moreover, of raising questions about the occupational hazards that poets face and about their relation to a world of readers and reviewers.</p>\n<p>In one way, at least, Kierkegaard's parable is untrue to the experience of American poets, who rarely have to fend off legions of avid admirers. But the notion that the job of the critic is to find fault with the poetry -- that the aims of criticism and of poetry are opposed -- is still with us or, rather, has returned after a hiatus. It was once erroneously thought that devastating reviews caused John Keats's untimely death in his twenty-sixth year. Lord Byron in <i>Don Juan</i> had Keats and his reviewers in mind when he wrote, \"Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, / Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.\" In reality, however, it was not criticism but consumption that cut short Keats's life.1 Many of us delight in Oscar Wilde's witty paradoxes that blur the identities of artist and critic.2 The critical essays of T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden are continuous with their poems and teach us that criticism is a matter not of enforcing the \"laws of aesthetics\" or meting out sentences as a judge might pronounce them in court. Rather, the poet as critic engages with works of literature and enriches our understanding and enjoyment of them. Yet today more than a few commentators seem intent on punishing the authors they review. It has grown into a phenomenon. In the March 2009 issue of <i>Poetry</i>, the critic Jason Guriel defends \"negativity\" as \"the poetry reviewer's natural posture, the default position she assumes before scanning a single line.\" The title of Guriel's piece sums it up: \"Going Negative.\"</p>\n<p>The romantic image of the poet as a vulnerable personage in a hostile universe has not gone out of currency. The poet is doomed to go unrecognized and to pay dearly for his music-making powers. The gift of poetry comes not as an unalloyed blessing but as the incidental virtue of a defect or as compensation for a loss, an injury, an ailment, a deficiency. Edmund Wilson coined the phrase that readily comes to mind for this dynamic of compensatory balance: \"the wound and the bow.\" Before it served Wilson as the title of a collection of his essays (1941), the phrase headed his study of the myth of Philoctetes, which the critic took as paradigmatic of the artist's situation. Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles treated the myth in plays; the <i>Philoctetes</i> of Sophocles survives. The hero, who excels even Odysseus at archery, possesses the invincible bow that once belonged to Hercules. Philoctetes joins the Greeks in their assault on Troy but is bitten by a poisonous snake, and the suppurating wound emits so foul an odor that his comrades-in-arms abandon him on the island of Lemnos. There he is stranded for ten miserable years. But when a Trojan prophet is forced to reveal that the Greeks will fail to conquer Troy without the unerring bow of Philoctetes, a platoon is dispatched to reenlist the archer -- who is understandably reluctant to return to the fray -- and to recover his arms by any means necessary. In Sophocles, Philoctetes is cured at Troy. He goes on to kill Paris, the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen precipitated the epic conflict, and he becomes one of the heroes of the Greek victory. One lesson, according to Wilson, is that \"genius and disease, like strength and mutilation, may be inextricably bound up together.\" In the most speculative and provocative sentence in the essay, Wilson ventures that \"somewhere even in the fortunate Sophocles there had been a sick and raving Philoctetes.\"</p>\n<blockquote><small>1. Not that the critics were blameless. The anonymous reviewer writing for <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i> (August 1818) called Keats's <i>Endymion</i> \"imperturbable driveling idiocy.\" Endymion was supposed to be \"a Greek shepherd loved by a Grecian goddess,\" but in Keats's hands, he was \"merely a young Cockney rhymester.\"</small></blockquote>\n<blockquote><small>2. In <i>The Critic as Artist</i>, Wilde radically revises Matthew Arnold on the function of criticism. According to Arnold, the endeavor is \"to see the object as in itself it really is.\" According to Wilde, the aim is \"to see the object as in itself it really is not.\"</small></blockquote>\n<p>W. H. Auden's early prose poem, \"Letter to a Wound\" (1931), is a powerful modern statement of the theme: \"You are so quiet these days that I get quite nervous, remove the dressing. I am safe, you are still there.\" Addressing the wound as \"you\" is not merely a grammatical convenience but the vehicle of a linguistic transformation; the ailment becomes an active, willful muse and companion -- albeit one whose traits include \"insane jealousy,\" \"bad manners,\" and a \"passion for spoiling things.\" The letter writer has learned to live with his incurable condition as with a secret partner, an illicit lover. They have even gone through a \"honeymoon stage\" together. \"Thanks to you,\" Auden writes, \"I have come to see a profound significance in relations I never dreamt of considering before, an old lady's affection for a small boy, the Waterhouses and their retriever, the curious bond between Offal and Snig, the partners in the hardware shop in the front.\" The wound is not named, though we read of a visit to a surgeon, who begins a sentence, \"I'm afraid,\" and need not add a word. The particular virtue of this epistolary prose poem is that \"I\" and \"you,\" a pair of pronouns, are raised to the level of a universal duality and are therefore greater than any specific duality that seems appropriate -- whether \"artist\" and \"wound,\" or \"self\" and \"soul,\" or \"ego\" and \"id,\" or \"lover\" and \"beloved.\"</p>\n<p>It is difficult not to fall under the spell of Wilson's wound and bow or of the corresponding myth in the Hebraic tradition. In the thirty-second chapter of Genesis, Jacob -- who twice in the past had got the better of his brother Esau, both times by cunning or deceit -- must wrestle with \"a man\" who will not reveal his name and who must flee the scene at daybreak. The struggle takes place on the eve of his first encounter with Esau after many years, in the deep darkness of the night, and it is physical combat of a kind not associated with Jacob. When he fights the angel to a standstill, he receives a blessing and a new name, Israel (because he has \"contended with God and men and has prevailed\"). But he has also suffered a wound \"in the hollow of his thigh\" that causes him to limp thereafter. The story is rich and mysterious in inverse proportion to its length: nine biblical verses. Though each is said to be a source of power, the Hebrew blessing bestowed on Jacob is utterly different from the Greek bow. Yet at bottom we find the familiar dialectic of compensation.</p>\n<p>Such myths may console us. The logic of Emerson's essay \"Compensation\" has saved my spirits on many a dismal afternoon. \"The sure years reveal the deep emotional force that underlies all facts,\" Emerson writes. \"The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.\" It is to Emerson's essay that I turn when I need to tamp down the impulses of resentment or envy and reconcile myself to realities. There is wisdom here and truth, a counterargument if not exactly a solution to the problem of evil that Gerard Manley Hopkins stated summarily: \"Why do sinners' ways prosper? And why must / Disappointment all I endeavor end?\"</p>\n<p>There is also, however, a danger in the intimate association of genius and illness, especially mental illness, especially at a time when many of us engaged in the discourse of poetry come into contact with ever-increasing numbers of impressionable young people who want to study creative writing. The romantic conception of the poet can lead too easily to self-pity or worse, the glorification of madness and the idealization of the self-inflicted wound. We need to remember that poetry springs from joy as often as from sorrow: the impulse to praise is as strong as the impulse to mourn. Lionel Trilling's essay \"Art and Neurosis\" is a vital corrective to the tendency to assent too readily to propositions obscuring the differences between genius and madness. Trilling accepts the premise that all of us, including \"the fortunate Sophocles,\" are ill; we are all neurotic. In that case, it is not the primal hurt but the ability to rise above it that distinguishes the artist. Poetry is not a matter of divine madness but the product of labor and conscious mind. \"Nothing is so characteristic of the artist as his power of shaping his work, of subjugating his raw material, however aberrant it be from what we call normality,\" Trilling writes. \"What marks the artist is his power to shape the material of pain we all have.\"</p>\n<p>My favorite sentence in Kierkegaard's parable is the one in which poets and critics are considered identical except that the latter lack the very qualities -- the anguish in the heart and the music on the lips -- that are definitive of the poet. For many years I resisted Kierkegaard's \"either/ or\" logic. I felt that there needn't be a structural enmity between poetry and criticism. Now I wonder.</p>\n<p>The characteristic badness of literary criticism in the 1980s was that it was heavily driven by theory and saddled with an unlovely vocabulary. T. S. Eliot, in \"The Function of Criticism\" (1923), says he \"presumes\" that \"no exponent of criticism\" has \"ever made the preposterous assumption that criticism is an autotelic activity\" -- that is, an activity to be undertaken as an end in itself without connection to a work of literature. Eliot did not figure on post-structuralism and the critic's declaration of independence from the text. If you wanted criticism \"constantly to be confronted with examples of poetry,\" as R. P. Blackmur recommends in \"A Critic's Job of Work,\" you were in for a bad time in the 1980s. The academic critics' disregard of contemporary poetry paralleled the rise of creative writing as a field of study and, partly in consequence, the writing of poetry did not suffer, though from time to time you would hear the tired refrain that poetry -- like God, the novel as a form, and the author altogether -- had died. This shibboleth itself has not perished. <i>Newsweek</i> reports that, despite \"anecdotal evidence that interest in poetry is on the rise,\" statistics show a decline. \"Is an art form dying?\" the magazine asks.3 Donald Hall wrote the definitive response to these premature death notices, \"Death to the Death of Poetry,\" which served as the introduction to <i>The Best American Poetry 1989</i>. Hall's assertion remains valid: \"American poetry survives; it even prevails.\"</p>\n<blockquote><small>3. Marc Bain, \"The End of Verse?\" <i>Newsweek</i>, March 25, 2009.</small></blockquote>\n<p>Poetry criticism at its worst today is mean in spirit and spiteful in intent, as if determined to inflict the wound that will spur the artist to new heights if it does not cripple him or her. Somewhere along the line, the notion took hold that poets were reluctant to write honestly about their peers. But in the absence of critics who are not themselves poets, surely the antidote is not to encourage the habit of rejection without explanation, denunciation without a reasoned argument, and a slam of the gavel in high dudgeon as if a poem were a felony. Hostile criticism, criticism by insult, may have entertainment value, but animus does not guarantee honesty. As one who knows from firsthand experience what a book reviewer faces when writing on deadline, I can tell the real thing when I see it, and the hysterical over-the-top attack is as often as not the product of a pose. Every critic knows it is easier (and more fun) to write a ruthless review rather than a measured one. As a reviewer, you're not human if you don't give vent to your outrage once or twice -- if only to get the impulse out of you. If you have too good a time writing hostile reviews, you'll injure not only your sensibility but your soul. Frank O'Hara felt he had no responsibility to respond to a bad poem. It'll \"slip into oblivion without my help,\" he would say.</p>\n<p>William Logan typifies the bilious reviewer of our day. He has attacked, viciously, a great many American poets; I, too, have been the object of his scorn. Logan is the critic as O'Hara defined the species: \"the assassin of my orchards.\" You can rely on him to go for the most wounding gesture. Michael Palmer writes a \"Baudelaire Series\" of poems, for example, and Logan comments, \"Baudelaire would have eaten Mr. Palmer for breakfast, with salt.\" The poems of Australian poet Les Murray seem \"badly translated out of Old Church Slavonic with only a Russian phrase book at hand.\" Reviewing a book by Adrienne Rich is a task that Logan feels he could almost undertake in his sleep. Reading C. K. Williams is \"like watching a dog eat its own vomit.\"</p>\n<p>For many years, Logan reserved his barbs for the poets of our time. More recently he has sneered at Emily Dickinson (\"a bloodless recluse\") and condescended to Emerson (\"a mediocre poet\"). And still the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> turned to Logan to review the new edition of Frank O'Hara's <i>Selected Poems</i> last summer. Logan's piece began with the observation that O'Hara's death at the age of forty in a freak accident was a \"good career move.\" This is not a particularly original phrase, but in O'Hara's case it is doubly unkind, giving the false impression that he died by his own hand.</p>\n<p>Logan's treatment of Langdon Hammer's Library of America edition of Hart Crane's poetry and prose -- which ran in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> in January 2007 -- provoked among many readers the feeling that here he had gone too far. The piece dwelled on Crane's \"sexual appetites,\" which \"were voracious and involved far too many sailors,\" and included a flip dismissal of Crane's poem \"Chaplinesque\" (a \"dreadful mess\"). The review triggered off a spate of letters that the Times duly printed. Rosanna Warren summed up what many felt: \"Snide biographical snippets about homosexuality and alcoholism are not literary criticism, nor are poems illuminated by sarcastic bons mots ('a Myth of America conceived by Tiffany and executed by Disney,' 'like being stuck in a mawkish medley from <i>Show Boat</i> and <i>Oklahoma!</i>'). Crane's revelatory weaknesses as well as his, yes, genius, deserved a more responsible accounting.\"</p>\n<p>Wounded by the outcry, Logan wrote a lengthy defense of himself and his procedures in the October 2008 issue of <i>Poetry</i>. More letters to the editor followed: three pages of them in the December 2008 issue, along with a concluding comment by Logan longer than the combined efforts of the correspondents. For one who routinely seeks to give offense, Logan turns out to be thin-skinned. In the end he falls back on the argument that it is fruitless to argue in matters of taste. \"The problem with taste is, yours is right and everyone else's is wrong,\" Logan writes. Bosh. The real problem is that Logan confuses taste with bias. Using the Romantic poets as an example, he writes: \"You can't stand that ditherer Coleridge, she can't stand that whiner Keats, I can't stand that dry fussbudget Wordsworth, and we all hate Shelley.\" Only someone for whom poets are merely names, abstractions that never had a flesh-and-blood existence, could so gleefully reduce these poets to those epithets. But when Logan returns to \"Chaplinesque,\" Hart Crane's \"hapless little\" poem (and how that unnecessary \"little\" rankles), he gives the game away.</p>\n<p>Here is \"Chaplinesque\":</p>\n<blockquote>We make our meek adjustments,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Contented with such random consolations</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As the wind deposits</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In slithered and too ample pockets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For we can still love the world, who find</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A famished kitten on the step, and know</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Recesses for it from the fury of the street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Or warm torn elbow coverts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We will sidestep, and to the final smirk</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Facing the dull squint with what innocence</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And what surprise!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And yet these fine collapses are not lies</blockquote>\n<blockquote>More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We can evade you, and all else but the heart:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>What blame to us if the heart live on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The game enforces smirks; but we have seen</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The moon in lonely alleys make</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And through all sound of gaiety and quest</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.</blockquote>\n<p>To Logan the poem's concluding lines are self-evidently \"embarrassing,\" an adjective he uses twice without substantiation. In the three separate pieces in which Logan brings up the poem, he lazily repeats the same charges, uses the same modifiers: the penultimate stanza of \"Chaplinesque\" is \"hapless and tone deaf,\" the ending is \"schmaltz,\" and the poem as a whole is evidence that the poet was \"star-struck\" by Charlie Chaplin, whose movies inspired Crane.</p>\n<p>Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but a professional critic has the responsibility to develop opinions, not just to state them. Rather than make the effort to see how Crane's poem works as a response to Chaplin's film <i>The Kid</i>, Logan ridicules the \"star-struck\" poet, likening Chaplin then to Angelina Jolie now, a comparison of dubious value that manages to insult everyone including Chaplin, Crane, Angelina Jolie, and the \"seventy-seven American poets\" who, Logan says in his patented blend of self-regard and snarky wit, have written odes to Jolie because Logan wrote that Crane met Chaplin after writing \"Chaplinesque.\"</p>\n<p>I do not claim to comprehend \"Chaplinesque\" perfectly, but I believe that the lover of poetry will recognize the genius in this poem before any irritable reaching after paraphrase. Crane's repeated use of the homonym for his first name -- \"We can evade you, and all else but the heart: What blame to us if the heart live on\" -- seems to me, for example, well worth pondering in the context of the lines' pronomial ambiguity. The poem's opening stanzas are so rich one wants to say them over and over, to speculate on the idea of the Chaplin persona as an image of the poet, of the \"famished kitten\" as an image of poetry, or to contemplate the remarkable sequence of \"smirk,\" \"thumb,\" and \"squint\" in the third stanza. The finger-in-the-eye slapstick comedy routine has never seemed so threatening, even if we can \"Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb / That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us.\" The poem's ending is particularly memorable. You may not make easy sense of that \"grail of laughter\" created by the moon out of a garbage can in a deserted alley. But this arresting image that fuses the sacred and the profane, sky and slum, will not soon depart from your consciousness. The key phrase here, \"a grail of laughter,\" is a great example of a poetic image that defies logical analysis, for we instinctively grasp it as a figure of the sublime, though we know that a grail cannot be \"of\" laughter in any conventional sense. The laughter is the \"sound of gaiety and quest,\" and \"we\" can see the miracle, behold the grail, because we have heard the cry of the alley cat, and we know that poetry is not simply a grand visionary quest but also something very precious and vulnerable, a kitten in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>The critic whose take on \"Chaplinesque\" I'd like to see is Christopher Ricks. Ricks begins his book <i>T. S. Eliot and Prejudice</i> with a reading of the most audacious poetic debut of the twentieth century. You might have thought that \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" would require the critic to digress from a consideration of prejudice, the focal point of Ricks's study of Eliot. Not so. Ricks quotes the uncanny stand-alone couplet that Eliot uses twice: \"In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.\" What have scholars said about the lines? The Oxford don Helen Gardner hears \"high-pitched feminine voices\" that are absurdly inadequate to the \"giant art\" of Michelangelo. Grover Smith says he has \"no doubt\" the women are talking \"tediously and ignorantly.\" To Hugh Kenner, the women are \"trivial.\" John Crowe Ransom, discerning \"contempt\" in Eliot's voice, rephrases the couplet as a rhetorical question about the women: \"How could they have had any inkling of that glory which Michelangelo had put into his marbles and his paintings?\"</p>\n<p>Yet, as Ricks observes, nowhere does Eliot tell us how to react to these women entering and leaving the drawing room. He chooses \"talking\" to describe what they are doing when he could as easily have said \"prattling.\" He uses no adjective to denigrate the women, though at his disposal he had those I've already given (\"trivial,\" \"ignorant,\" \"tedious\") and more (\"shallow,\" \"affected,\" \"fashionable\"). Nor does Eliot praise the \"glory\" of Michelangelo's \"giant art\" by way of emphasizing the discrepancy between the women and the object of their conversation. It is a measure of Eliot's subtlety and skill that he disdains such modifiers as would bully a reader into the desired response. But Ricks's larger point is that even redoubtable critics are unaware of \"how much their sense of the lines is incited by prejudice.\"</p>\n<p>Ricks's treatment of Eliot illustrates how canny a close reader he is. It may remind us also of the pleasure to be had from such acts of critical acumen. And if, as Wordsworth insisted in the preface to the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, the giving of pleasure constitutes the poet's first obligation to the reader, may it not be reasonable to expect the critic of poetry to honor this same imperative? Yet what Wordsworth calls the \"grand elementary principle of pleasure\" is missing from discussions of contemporary poetry. Schadenfreude is a poor substitute. True delight accompanies edification when a lover of poetry shows us how to read a poem on its own terms, paying it the respect of careful attention, leaving aside the prejudices of the anathematist, the ideologue, the apostle of received opinion, or the bully on the block.</p>\n<p>It may just be that the most appealing alternative to the negativity of contemporary criticism is the selective inclusiveness of a dedicated editor. For thirty-six years David Wagoner edited <i>Poetry Northwest</i>. The value of a supportive editor is incalculable, and Wagoner was among the best. His editorial practice can be seen as an extension of his humane poetics. For more than a half century, he has written about ordinary lives and real landscapes with grace and emotional complexity. A master of the plain style, for whom clarity and directness are cardinal virtues, he is a poet of wisdom and wonder. In their unostentatious way, his poems remind us of what it means to be human. Although we set our sights on the heavens, what we see from the wrong end of the telescope may prove more vital, for it \"shows us just how little the gods see / if they look back.\" Yet like actors in a grand comedy we turn and change, turn and change, \"like young heavenly objects / endlessly reembodied\" with \"wardrobes as various / as the wonders of new stars.\" I am conflating quotations from two poems in Wagoner's latest collection, <i>A Map of the Night</i>, which appeared last year -- the year Wagoner spent reading for <i>The Best American Poetry 2009</i>. He has selected poems from an unprecedented number of print or electronic journals: fifty-six. The poets explore subjects ranging from love and death to God, Freud, the beauty of the matriarchs in Genesis, the animals with which we share the planet, \"the land to the south of our neighbors to the north,\" the movies, and \"The Great American Poem.\" A number of the poets address crises in the body politic: the damaged Mississippi Gulf Coast (\"Liturgy\"), the assassination of Daniel Pearl (\"Forty\"), the massacre at Virginia Tech (\"Ringtone\"). We read about the prospect of a change in government (\"A Sea-Change\") and are confronted with \"A Democratic Vista\" and the assurance that \"Ultimately Justice Directs Them.\"</p>\n<p>The biggest political story of 2008, the campaign and election of Barack Obama as president of the United States, sparked great enthusiasm among American poets. No sooner had the election results come in than the speculation began as to whom the incoming administration would tap to read a poem at the inauguration. Only two previous presidents (Kennedy and Clinton) had incorporated a poem in the inaugural proceedings, but everyone was confident that Obama would renew this tradition and everyone was right. Elizabeth Alexander was entrusted with the task. But even after her name was disclosed, the print and broadcast media continued to run stories on the importance of poetry in the national discourse. Perusal of the poems written by U.S. presidents of the past revealed Lincoln to be our best presidential poet. Anecdotes surfaced on Theodore Roosevelt's admiration of Edwin Arlington Robinson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's recognition of Archibald MacLeish's talents as a speechwriter, librarian, and adviser at large. The Associated Press reporter Nancy Benac asked a number of poets to write -- and, where practicable, recite for the camera -- ceremonial poems written with Obama's inauguration in mind. Billy Collins, Yusef Komunyakaa, Alice Walker, Christopher Funkhouser, Amiri Baraka, cowboy poet Ted Newman, Julia Alvarez, Gary Soto, Bob Holman, and I composed poems for the occasion. The results are still accessible via the Internet.</p>\n<p>The Internet has multiplied the number of places in which a poem may appear. If it was difficult previously to cover American poetry, even with a company of skillful readers, it is now quite impossible. As David Wagoner notes in his introduction to this year's <i>Best American Poetry</i>, there are more venues for poetry than ever before. Web sites, zines, and blogs have enabled us to close up the lag between the composition and dissemination of any piece of writing. It remains to be seen how this technological advance will affect the nature of the writing itself, although the odds are that it will abet not only the tendency toward informality but also the impulse to buck it by emphasizing new and unusual forms: the abecedarius (or double abecedarius), the lipogram, the use of \"found forms\" such as the index of first lines in the back of a book of poems. Poems in such forms as these have turned up in recent and current volumes of <i>The Best American Poetry</i>, as have, to be sure, sonnets, sestinas, riddles, prose poems, a villanelle, a cento, a blues poem, a pantoum. The rediscovery of old forms and the fabrication of new ones is one notable tendency in contemporary poetry. A second is the growing appeal of the conversational style that David Kirby calls \"ultra talk\": a poem that sounds as natural as talk -- if we could script our talk. After observing that \"every revolution in poetry\" is at base \"a return to common speech,\" T. S. Eliot in \"The Music of Poetry\" (1942) goes on to give the rationale for this sort of \"talk poetry\": \"No poetry, of course, is ever exactly the same speech that the poet talks and hears: but it has to be in such a relation to the speech of his time that the listener or reader can say 'that is how I should talk if I could talk poetry.' \"</p>\n<p>In 2008, <i>The Best American Poetry</i> launched our blog, which seemed at first to be an indulgence, then a convenience, before we understood that it could function as a kind of magazine, the contents of which change daily and feature an ever-changing roster of contributing writers and columnists. We post poems and comments on poems but also news, links, photos, illustrations, and prose on any subject that engages the mind of a poet. There are certain recurring features. We like aphorisms (\"There are people who are too intelligent to become authors, but they do not become critics\": W. H. Auden) and brainteasers (\"Lives in winter, / Dies in summer, / And grows with its root upwards\").4 From time to time we have run contests. Mark Strand judged Gerald Greland the winner of the inaugural ode contest we posted a day or two after Barack Obama's electoral victory. Paul Violi judged Frank Osen the winner of the previous year's competition, in which contestants were asked to decipher an anagram and to write an acrostic poem based on the result. I am still marveling at the notion that, in contrast to the strict limitations of space in a print magazine, we can publish 365 poems in a calendar year. And we can do things like monitor the cultural markers on an acclaimed television show.</p>\n<blockquote><small>4. \"When a riddler, using the bold weapon of metaphor, forces us to contemplate an icicle as a plant, it is an imaginative coup; briefly, and in a small way, our sense of the structure of reality is shaken.\" Richard Wilbur, \"The Persistence of Riddles\" in <i>The Catbird's Song: Prose Pieces 1963-1995</i> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1997), p. 44.</small></blockquote>\n<p>The spirit of Frank O'Hara hovered over the second season of the TV series <i>Mad Men</i> on AMC in 2008. In the first episode, ad man Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm) finds himself at a Midtown bar not far from where O'Hara loitered during his lunch hours when he worked as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art. On the barstool next to Draper sits a man with horn-rimmed glasses and curly hair reading O'Hara's <i>Meditations in an Emergency</i>. It is 1962. John F. Kennedy is president. Marilyn Monroe is still alive. Draper asks the man about the book. \"You probably wouldn't like it,\" he is told. But Don buys it, we see him reading it in his office, and as the episode concludes, he mails the book to person or persons unknown and, in a voice-over, recites the fourth and final part of O'Hara's poem \"Mayakovsky\" in <i>Meditations in an Emergency</i>. The unforgettable phrase \"the catastrophe of my personality\" occurs here. The charm of such ironic self-deprecation, which is part of O'Hara's character armor, extends to the voice-over. The last words in \"Mayakovsky\" imply a split in the speaker's personality: \"It may be the coldest day of / the year, what does he think of / that? I mean, what do I? And if I do, / perhaps I am myself again.\" The grammatical fact that, in a narrative, the same person can be either \"I\" or \"he\" turns into an apt metaphor for Don Draper, who bears someone else's name -- he switched identities (we learned in season one) with a fallen comrade in a skirmish during the Korean War.</p>\n<p><i>Meditations in an Emergency</i> returns as the title of the thirteenth and final episode in season two of <i>Mad Men</i>. Marilyn Monroe has died. It is October. President Kennedy is addressing the nation on TV. Virtually all the characters in the show are going through an emergency of one kind or another, while the country as a whole faces the grave emergency that was the Cuban Missile Crisis. Unlike radio, which has always been a congenial medium for poems and verse plays, TV and poetry have seemed as irreconcilable as dance and architecture. Not the least of Matthew Weiner's accomplishments is the brilliant way he has used O'Hara's poetry to govern the themes of a dramatic series on TV. Mad Men is a big hit, sales of Meditations in an Emergency continue to climb, and a new generation of readers has fallen in love with the poems of Frank O'Hara.</p>\n<p> Copyright © 2009 by David Lehman</p>",

It remains remarkable in its ability to present the African-American experience through poetry that speaks for itself without the distraction of artwork or the need to trumpet itself as being multicultural. This revised and updated edition has 21 new selections, representing 19 poets (9 of them women), added to the thematic sections of the original title. Now, readers can meet more contemporary writers such as Rita Dove, Maya Angelou, and Ishmael Reed as well as classic black poets like Countee Cullen, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Langston Hughes. An introduction puts the book in historical context and a foreword offers encouragement to a new generation of readers. Notes and biographies have been updated and added where appropriate and Andrews's spare but evocative line drawings still open each section. Because of the historical context of many of the poems, the book will be much in demand during Black History Month, but it should be used and treasured as part of the larger canon of literature to be enjoyed by all Americans at all times of the year. An indispensable addition to library collections.Carrie Schadle, New York Public Library\n\n</article>"

      "excerpt": "<h1>Mental Floss: Scatterbrained</h1>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\">\n<b>By Virginia Editors of Mental Floss</b>  \n<h4 class=\"null1\">HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.</h4>\n<b>Copyright © 2006</b> <b>Virginia Editors of Mental Floss<br>\n All right reserved.</b><br>\n <b>ISBN: 0060882506</b> <br>\n \n<hr noshade size='1'>\n<p class=\"null2\">Chapter One</p>\n<p><b>01 Greece (the Country):</b><br>\n <i>The Only Facts You Need to Know</i></p>\n<p>Everyone knows the story of the marathon: Some Greek guy ran for about 20 miles from the city of Marathon to neighboring Athens, whereupon he gasped, \"<i>Nike</i>,\" and promptly died. (That wasn't an early form of product placement, just the Greek word for \"victory.\") You might not know, however, that at the first modern Olympics in 1896, the marathon distance was set at 24.85 miles (40 kilometers). So why is it 26.2 today? To please the King of England, of course! For the 1908 Olympics in London, the distance was lengthened to 26 miles so the course could go from Windsor Castle to White City Stadium and then lengthened another 385 yards so the race could finish right in front of Kind Edward VII's stadium box. Now you know whose name to curse when staggering those last miserable marathon steps.</p>\n<p>The first winner of the modern Olympic marathon, incidentally, was a Greek. Spyridon Louis, a postal worker (who trained, we imagine, by running away from ferocious dogs). He finished in 2:58:50.</p>\n<p>And you thought 99 bottles of beer on the wall was bad: The Greek national anthem, with its 158 stanzas, is the longest national anthemin the world.</p>\n<p>If you've ever found yourself legs akimbo, feet in stirrups, wondering why they call it a \"Pap\" smear: Greek-American George Papanicolaou created the test, which has helped reduce cervical cancer fatality rates by almost 50 percent since its introduction in the 1940s. (For some reason, \"Papanicolaou smear\" never caught on.)</p>\n<p><b>02 Means to an End:</b><br>\n <i>Unpleasant Execution Methods Throughout History<br>\n (In Reverse Order of Preference!)</i></p>\n<p><i><b>Ling Chi:</b></i> A slow, excruciating death, implemented a millennium ago by China's Song dynasty, <i>ling chi</i> (or \"slicing\") entails a piecemeal disassembling of the arms and legs by knife, culminating in decapitation. On the upside, luckier victims got to indulge in a good bit of opium beforehand, as an act of mercy. We'd argue that a better act of mercy would be not to carve up living people, but that's just us. The good news is <i>ling chi</i> was abolished. The bad news is that it wasn't until 1905, only 900 years late.</p>\n<p><b>Sawing:</b> Employed by historical free spirits like Caligula, Spanish Inquisitors, and--whaddya know--the ancient Chinese, death by sawing is kind of like the horror franchise <i>Saw</i>, except more horrific and not a movie. The convicted was strung up by the feet and sawed in twain, beginning at the crotch; his upside-down position ensured a continuous flow of blood (or whatever blood remained) to the brain, so he barely had to miss a moment of the terror until it was over. Recipients included such heinous criminals as adulterers and sodomites, plus a few saints, maybe the prophet Isaiah, and any young woman thought to be carrying Satan in her womb. That's the thing about the Beelzebaby--you never can be too sure, so kudos to the Spanish, because during the entire Inquisition, Satan's spawn wasn't born even once.</p>\n<p><b>Boiling Alive:</b> Fairly self-explanatory. Historically, execution by boiling is far more widespread than you'd think. In fact, it was prevalent in the Roman Empire, ancient China, Egypt, throughout the Middle East (where to conserve water they used oil), classical Japan, 17th-century India, England under Henry VIII, and Uganda under Idi Amin in the 1970s. More recently, the gruesome act seemed relegated exclusively to members of the crustacean family---until an autopsy report emerged from Uzbekistan in 2002 implicating the practice in at <i>least</i> one political prisoner's demise.</p>\n<p>Burning at the Stake: Particularly effective in the elimination of witches, heretics, Christians, Zoroastrians, Nordic thugs, British traitors (females only, please), homosexuals, and anyone else whose flesh is not flame-retardant, burning at the stake is the straightforward but reliable, the Toyota Corolla of capital punishment. Its advantages are obvious: It's easy to do--all you need is a stake and some burning--and it makes for a flashy public-service message. The upside of death by fire: You may die of carbon dioxide poisoning before you're engulfed by flame. The downside: You might not. Given the choice, we'd rather go like '30s movie star Lupe Velez, who committed suicide in 1944 by overdosing on sleeping pills and then reportedly drowning in her toilet. . . .</p>\n<p class=\"null2\">03 Toilet Facts</p>\n<p>Toilets are like oxygen or boyfriends: You tend not to think much about them until the moment you can't find any. Maybe it's time to give your W.C. a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. After all, you probably don't notice but you pay respect to the porcelain god six to eight times per day, on average--or thirty to forty times per day, if you're a six-year-old on a road trip (just joshing, kids). That makes for 2,500 trips to Flushville per year, comprising an average of three full years of your life. That's enough time to get a law degree . . . if only you hadn't spent it reading <i>mental_floss.</i></p>\n<p>Nazi war criminal and Gestapo founder Hermann Göring despised toilet paper (seriously). He refused to use it and instead bought handkerchiefs in bulk.</p>\n<p>In 1993, an Argentinian prankster switched the \"Women's\" and \"Men's\" signs in a series of public toilets. We don't see why this is particularly clever--the gender divide is the same whether you all go to Room A or Room B (except that women will get to peek at some urinals). Apparently, the Argentine government wasn't impressed by it either: They sentenced the bathroom bandit to three years in the clink (which supposedly left him flushed).</p>\n<p>The separate stall, a welcome innovation if ever there was one, is a relatively modern concept. The Romans and Greeks, for instance, saw toilet time as a social occasion and sat down in groups at their open-air toilets. That brings us back to the Greeks, which brings us to . . .<br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i> <br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n Excerpted from <b>Mental Floss: Scatterbrained</b> by <b>Virginia Editors of Mental Floss</b> Copyright © 2006 by Virginia Editors of Mental Floss.

The four-page preface clearly explains her choices. Charters, who came of age during the 1960s, concedes that some of the pieces are very personal, meant to reflect her intense emotional and intellectual experiences. The selections and omissions are determined to some extent by the ten topical sections: civil rights, war resistance, free speech, the counterculture (largely in music as rendered here), mind-altering drugs, Beat literature, African-American arts, the women's movement (especially the sexual revolution), environmental protection, and \"elegies\" (portraits of ten people who died during the decade). Charters (English/Univ. of Connecticut) gives short shrift to innovative pieces of narrative journalism--Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Joan Didion, Truman Capote are all excluded--but otherwise her choices seem unarguable. The introductions to each selection provide pertinent context, which is especially important because many of the selections are excerpts from books. A 25-page chronology of the decade will prove useful for those born after 1960, as well as offering forgotten tidbits for middle-aged and elderly readers.\n\n</article>"

Chosen for their value as excellent examples of the art of biography as well as for their superb writing, the excerpts present a broad range of American life, and offer vivid insight into the real-life events that shaped their authors. Here, readers can learn about the time when Harry Crews, playing as a boy, fell into a vat of boiling water with a dead hog; Chris Offutt joined the circus and watched a tattooed woman swallow a fluorescent light; and Frank Conroy practiced yo-yo tricks.</p>",
      "excerpt": "<b>Harry Crews(1935)</b><br>\n<p><i>Harry Crews was born the son of a farmer in Bacon County, Georgia, and grew up there. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a sergeant, then attended the University of Florida, where he became a professor of English in 1974.</i></p>\n<p>Author of more than a dozen novels, from The Gospel Singer (1968) to Scar Lover (1992), Crews has also written stories, essays, and nonfiction.</p>\n<p>Crews's memoir, A Childhood: The Biography of a Place, describes the first six years of his life, under circumstances \"where there wasn't enough money to close up a dead man's eyes.\" His family lived on a series of tenant farms in Bacon County. His father died when he was two. The \"daddy\" in this memoir is his stepfather, whom he loved. Later he learned that this man was his uncle.</p>\n<b>From A Childhood</b><br>\n<p>It has always seemed to me that I was not so much born into this life as I awakened to it. I remember very distinctly the awakening and the morning it happened. It was my first glimpse of myself, and all that I know now—the stories, and everything conjured up by them, that I have been writing about thus far—I obviously knew none of then, particularly anything about my real daddy, whom I was not to hear of until I was nearly six years old, not his name, not even that he was my daddy. Or if I did hear of him, I have no memory of it.</p>\n<p>I awoke in the middle of the morning in early summer from the place I'd been sleeping in the curving roots of a giant oak tree in front of a large white house. Off to the right, beyond the dirt road, my goats were trailing along in the ditch, grazing in the tough wire grass that grew there.Their constant bleating shook the warm summer air. I always thought of them as my goats although my brother usually took care of them. Before he went to the field that morning to work, he had let them out of the old tobacco barn where they slept at night. At my feet was a white dog whose name was Sam. I looked at the dog and at the house and at the red gown with little pearl-colored buttons I was wearing, and I knew that the gown had been made for me by my Grandma Hazelton and that the dog belonged to me. He went everywhere I went, and he always took precious care of me.</p>\n<p>Precious. That was my mama's word for how it was between Sam and me, even though Sam caused her some inconvenience from time to time. If she wanted to whip me, she had to take me in the house, where Sam was never allowed to go. She could never touch me when I was crying if Sam could help it. He would move quietly—he was a dog not given to barking very much—between the two of us and show her his teeth. Unless she took me somewhere Sam couldn't go, there'd be no punishment for me.</p>\n<p>The house there just behind me, partially under the arching limbs of the oak tree, was called the Williams place. It was where I lived with my mama and my brother, Hoyet, and my daddy, whose name was Pascal. I knew when I opened my eyes that morning that the house was empty because everybody had gone to the field to work. I also knew, even though I couldn't remember doing it, that I had awakened sometime in midmorning and come out onto the porch and down the steps and across the clean-swept dirt yard through the gate weighted with broken plow points so it would swing shut behind me, that I had come out under the oak tree and lain down against the curving roots with my dog, Sam, and gone to sleep. It was a thing I had done before. If I ever woke up and the house was empty and the weather was warm—which was the only time I would ever awaken to an empty house—I always went out under the oak tree to finish my nap. It wasn't fear or loneliness that drove me outside; it was just something I did for reasons I would never be able to discover.</p>\n<p>I stood up and stretched and looked down at my bare feet at the hem of the gown and said: \"I'm almost five and already a great big boy.\" It was my way of reassuring myself, but it was also something my daddy said about me and it made me feel good because in his mouth it seemed to mean I was almost a man.</p>\n<p>Sam immediately stood up too, stretched, reproducing, as he always did, every move I made, watching me carefully to see which way I might go. I knew I ought not to be outside lying in the rough curve of root in my cotton gown. Mama didn't mind me being out there under the tree, but I was supposed to get dressed first. Sometimes I did; often I forgot.</p>\n<p>So I turned and went back through the gate, Sam at my heels, and across the yard and up the steps onto the porch to the front door. When I opened the door, Sam stopped and lay down to wait. He would be there when I came out, no matter which door I used. If I went out the back door, he would somehow magically know it and he would be there. If I came out the side door by the little pantry, he would know that, too, and he would be there. Sam always knew where I was, and he made it his business to be there, waiting.</p>\n<p>I went into the long, dim, cool hallway that ran down the center of the house. Briefly I stopped at the bedroom where my parents slept and looked in at the neatly made bed and all the parts of the room, clean, with everything where it was supposed to be, just the way mama always kept it. And I thought of daddy, as I so often did because I loved him so much. If he was sitting down, I was usually in his lap. If he was standing up, I was usually holding his hand. He always said soft funny things to me and told me stories that never had an end but always continued when we met again.</p>\n<p>He was tall and lean with flat high cheekbones and deep eyes and black thick hair which he combed straight back on his head. And under the eye on his left cheek was the scarred print of a perfect set of teeth. I knew he had taken the scar in a fight, but I never asked him about it and the teeth marks in his cheek only made him seem more powerful and stronger and special to me.</p>\n<p>He shaved every morning at the water shelf on the back porch with a straight razor and always smelled of soap and whiskey. I knew mama did not like the whiskey, but to me it smelled sweet, better even than the soap. And I could never understand why she resisted it so, complained of it so, and kept telling him over and over again that he would kill himself and ruin everything if he continued with the whiskey. I did not understand about killing himself and I did not understand about ruining everything, but I knew the whiskey somehow caused the shouting and screaming and the ugly sound of breaking things in the night. The stronger the smell of whiskey on him, though, the kinder and gentler he was with me and my brother.</p>\n<p>I went on down the hallway and out onto the back porch and finally into the kitchen that was built at the very rear of the house. The entire room was dominated by a huge black cast-iron stove with six eyes on its cooking surface. Directly across the room from the stove was the safe, a tall square cabinet with wide doors covered with screen wire that was used to keep biscuits and fried meat and rice or almost any other kind of food that had been recently cooked. Between the stove and the safe sat the table we ate off of, a table almost ten feet long, with benches on each side instead of chairs, so that when we put in tobacco, there would be enough room for the hired hands to eat.</p>\n<p>I opened the safe, took a biscuit off a plate, and punched a hole in it with my finger. Then with a jar of cane syrup, I poured the hole full, waited for it to soak in good, and then poured again. When the biscuit had all the syrup it would take, I got two pieces of fried pork off another plate and went out and sat on the back steps, where Sam was already lying in the warm sun, his ears struck forward on his head. I ate the bread and pork slowly, chewing for a long time and sharing it all with Sam.</p>\n<p>When we had finished, I went back into the house, took off my gown, and put on a cotton undershirt, my overalls with twin galluses that buckled on my chest, and my straw hat, which was rimmed on the edges with a border of green cloth and had a piece of green cellophane sewn into the brim to act as an eyeshade. I was barefoot, but I wished very much I had a pair of brogans because brogans were what men wore and I very much wanted to be a man. In fact, I was pretty sure I already was a man, but the only one who seemed to know it was my daddy. Everybody else treated me like I was still a baby.</p>\n<p>I went out the side door, and Sam fell into step behind me as we walked out beyond the mule barn where four mules stood in the lot and on past the cotton house and then down the dim road past a little leaning shack where our tenant farmers lived, a black family in which there was a boy just a year older than I was. His name was Willalee Bookatee. I went on past their house because I knew they would be in the field, too, so there was no use to stop.</p>\n<p> I went through a sapling thicket and over a shallow ditch and finally climbed a wire fence into the field, being very careful of my overalls on the barbed wire. I could see them all, my family and the black tenant family, far off there in the shimmering heat of the tobacco field. They were pulling cutworms off the tobacco. I wished I could have been out there with them pulling worms because when you found one, you had to break it in half, which seemed great good fun to me. But you could also carry an empty Prince Albert tobacco can in your back pocket and fill it up with worms to play with later.</p>",
      "synopsis": "<p><P>In <i>Modern American Memoirs,</i> two very discerning writers and readers have selected samples from 35 of the finest memoirs written in this century, including contributions by such diverse writers as Margaret Mead, Malcolm X, Maxine Hong Kingston, Loren Eisely, and Zora Neale Hurston. Chosen for their value as excellent examples of the art of biography as well as for their superb writing, the excerpts present a broad range of American life, and offer vivid insight into the real-life events that shaped their authors. Here, readers can learn about the time when Harry Crews, playing as a boy, fell into a vat of boiling water with a dead hog; Chris Offutt joined the circus and watched a tattooed woman swallow a fluorescent light; and Frank Conroy practiced yo-yo tricks.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Annie Dillard and publisher Cort Conley have collected excerpts from the memoirs of 35 20th-century American authors. The selections represent the best in autobiographical writing published between 1917 and 1992. Included are nine women and 26 men, both black and white, some better known than others, all distinguished writers and wonderful storytellers. Chris Offutt's \"The Same River Twice\" tells about the author's stint working in the circus; Anne Moody's \"Coming of Age in Mississippi\" describes her participation in the 1963 Woolworth sit-in. The editors precede each entry with a biographical and contextual note. There's an opening essay on the art of the memoirist and an afterword listing additional classics in the genre. This rich collection serves as an introduction to the nation's best modern writers and a primer on the American experience. Highly recommended for all libraries.-Carol A. McAllister, Coll. of William and Mary Lib., Williamsburg, Va.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><p>The latest edition of this annual, assembled by the acclaimed writer and editor Philip Zaleski, not only showcases some of the finest writing of the year but offers astute perceptions on subjects that are universal, timeless, and yet deeply personal. Culled from an impressive variety of sources and ranging over topics as disparate as Shaker furniture, perfume, and the monastic life, the essays and poems collected here share a search for purpose beyond the mundane -- and find answers in the likeliest and unlikeliest of sources.<p>Here you will find George Packer&#8217;s &#147;The Moderate Martyr,&#8221; a profile of the peaceful Islamic visionary Mahmoud Muhammad Taha, alongside Sridhar Pappu&#8217;s report on &#147;the Preacher,&#8221; Bishop T. D. Jakes, the entrepreneurially inclined leader of one of the largest churches in the country. Garry Wills questions whether it is possible (or even desirable) to live according to the maxim &#147;What would Jesus do?&#8221; In response to the recent spate of atheist attacks on organized religion, Marilynne Robinson offers an insightful critique of &#147;Hysterical Scientism.&#8221; Adam Gopnik explores the link between Shaker beliefs and the austere beauty of Shaker creations, and Joseph Epstein muses on the reasons for broken friendships. Some of the essays are deeply personal&#58; Mary Gordon examines her complex relationship with her mother, and Pico Iyer reveals the place where he goes to be himself.<p>Including powerful poetry from notable contributors such as Deborah Digges, Galway Kinnell, and John Updike, and an introduction by Harvey Cox, The Best American Spiritual Writing 2007 is one of those transformative &#147;magical books&#8221; that Zaleski describes in his foreword, a volume that gracefully probes the role of faith in modern life while offering both spiritual insight and literary excellence.<p></p>",

EARLY WORKS: ACTOS, BERNABE AND PENSAMIENTO SERPENTINE is three books in one: 1) a collection of one act plays by Valdez and the famous farmworker theater, El Teatro Campesino, 2) one of the first fully realized, full-length plays by Valdez alone, and 3) an original narrative poem by Luis Valdez. In the first part are collected the original, improvised works of El Teatro Campesino that deal with the exploitation of Mexican farm labor in the California fields, the discrimination found by Mexicans in the schools, and Mexicans being turned into cannon fodder by the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Bernabe is a touching, Lorcaesque poetic drama about a town fool's enchantment and ultimate unity with the earth. Pensamiento serpentino is a long, philosophical poem, based on Mayan thought and cosmology, which analyzes the cultural, religious and political circumstances of Mexican Americans and prepares a metaphysical framework for their future.</p>",

      "excerpt": "FROM THE INTRODUCTION\n<p>The seasons are both segments of time and states of mind. Though ourword ‘‘season’’ derives from the Latin for ‘‘sowing’’ and refers thereby only to spring, every culture has had terms – whether winter and summer, or rainy and dry – for the sequence of great climatic changes by which the world transforms itself every year. But it’s more than what is going on outside. Our hearts have seasons as well. Mostly, we call them moods, and we lay our plans by their accustomed recurrences. We recall the crucial moments in our lives by the weather that still swirls around them in memory. Weddings and family reunions, getaways and homecomings are most often scheduled by the season. Yes, we have urgent appointments and traditional holidays, our deadlines and habits. But our bodies and their tides of desire seem to move more slowly, and are governed by the larger, more dramatic and decisive movements of the sun itself – the arrival of light and the opulence of warmth, then their slow fading and cold withdrawal. Aren’t, in fact, the seasons like the stages of a love affair?</p>\n<p>This is where the poets come in. They are enthusiasts and brooders. Love and death are their stock-in-trade. But first of all, they are observers. A strong imagination begins with a keen eye. The poet is interested in both the detail and the scheme, in both the streak on the tulip and the nature of beauty which the flower represents. This is why the seasons have, down the centuries, had a special appeal for poets. (It’s interesting though obvious to note that modern poets from England and especially from New England, where weather patterns are more extreme, are more likely to write about the seasons than poets from more steadily temperate parts.) This book is a virtual anthology of small details, because the seasons invite us to catalogue the terms of our love for the world. It takes hours of observation to get the tiniest half-line right that describes, say, the precise shade of a bird’s wing in flight. And such details are then the starting-point of metaphor. We can’t see anything exactly as it is unless we first see it as something else.</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Editor Senelick (recipient of the George Jean Nathan Prize for dramatic criticism) has done an excellent job of selecting a wide-ranging, historically significant selection of theater reviews, essays, memoirs, diary entries, and criticism. Extending through time with pieces by such recognizable writers as Washington Irving, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain, as well as Henry Louis Gates, Susan Sontag, and Tony Kushner, this collection also includes lesser-known writers such as Olive Logan, who wrote \"About Nudity in the Theatre\" in 1866, and Congregational minister Rollin Lynde Hartt, who discusses melodrama as a positive benefit to the working class and its newfound leisure. Many of the writings included here can be found only in volumes that are not indexed and are housed in archives and rare-book collections. VERDICT This is not a documentary history or a survey of American theater and therefore stands somewhat alone on the theater studies shelf. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy here, and readers who love theater as well as history will be entertained for many hours.—Susan Peters, Univ. of Texas, Galveston\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><P><b>Bum Rush the Page</b> is a groundbreaking collection, capturing the best new work from the poets who have brought fresh energy, life, and relevance to American poetry.<P>&#8220;Here is a democratic orchestration of voices and visions, poets of all ages, ethnicities, and geographic locations coming together to create a dialogue and to jam&#8211;not slam. This is our mouth on paper, our hearts on our sleeves, our refusal to shut up and swallow our silence. These poems are tough, honest, astute, perceptive, lyrical, blunt, sad, funny, heartbreaking, and true. They shout, they curse, they whisper, and sing. But most of all, they tell it like it is.&#8221; <br>&#8211;Tony Medina, from the Introduction</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>To most readers, the hundreds of tightly rhymed, orally friendly poems here will read as \"slam.\" But in his introduction, Medina, a poet and activist, takes great pains to separate the poems from slam's crowd-pleasing limitations, and uses the term \"def jam\" to describe the political spoken-word poetry he and Rivera, also a poet-activist, have collected. Medina's and Rivera's emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book's design puts the poets' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as \"Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,\" \"Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow\" and \"Seeds of Resistance,\" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word \"mother.\" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas's then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>To most readers, the hundreds of tightly rhymed, orally friendly poems here will read as \"slam.\" But in his introduction, Medina, a poet and activist, takes great pains to separate the poems from slam's crowd-pleasing limitations, and uses the term \"def jam\" to describe the political spoken-word poetry he and Rivera, also a poet-activist, have collected. Medina's and Rivera's emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book's design puts the poets' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as \"Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,\" \"Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow\" and \"Seeds of Resistance,\" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word \"mother.\" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas's then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what \"outlaw literature\" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of \"reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,\" to say nothing of a \"culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart.\" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: \"Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!\"; Jim Carroll: \"'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,' he said, 'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers\") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: \"I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul\"; William Burroughs: \"Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force\"). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner's memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone's heartfelt plea, \"Please don't kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die\" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX's spot-on prediction that after his death \"the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate.'\" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection. Good stuff, if you like that sort of thing.</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>Is an outlaw writer one who threatens to fill Marshall McLuhan with pencil lead? The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what \"outlaw literature\" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of \"reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,\" to say nothing of a \"culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart.\" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: \"Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!\"; Jim Carroll: \"'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,' he said, 'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers\") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: \"I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul\"; William Burroughs: \"Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force\"). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner's memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone's heartfelt plea, \"Please don't kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die\" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX's spot-on prediction that after his death \"the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate.'\" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection. Good stuff, if you like that sort of thing.\n\n</article>"

Hartman, an eloquent, middle-aged prisoner convicted of murder at 19, tells a sad but unsentimental story: a rough childhood and a wish for invincibility fueled Hartman's youth and downfall, but in the time since, he has married in prison, fathered a child, and currently works to improve the broken U.S. prison system. Hartman discovered his talent in a writing class, after having abandoned drugs; using it, he examines up close the \"mad, violent circus\" of prison life, his place in it, and the fate of his fellow prisoners: \"Under the big tent of this brutally unnatural environment, few of us ever take the frightening step of analyzing our deeper motives.\" <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

      "excerpt": "<p>Introduction: Americans Dreaming</p>\n<p>Whenever anyone asks my opinion about the difference between novels and short stories, I tell them that there is no distinction between the genres. They are essentially the same thing, I always reply.<br>\n How can you say that? the fiction lover asks. Stories are small gems, perfectly cut to expose every facet of an idea, which is in turn illuminated by ten thousand tiny shafts of light.<br>\n But I hold my ground, answering the metaphor with a simile. A novel, I say, is like a mountain—superior, vast, and immense. Its apex is in the clouds and it appears to us as a higher being—a divinity. Mountains loom and challenge; they contain myriad life forms and cannot be seen by anyone attempting the climb. Mountains can be understood only by years of negotiating their trails and sheer faces. They contain a wide variety of atmospheres and are complex and immortal.<br>\n You cannot approach a mountain unless you are completely prepared for the challenge. In much the same way, you can’t begin to read (or write) a novel without attempting to embrace a life much larger than the range of any singular human experience.<br>\n Thinking in this way, I understand the mountain and the novel to be impossible in everyday human terms. Both emerge from a distance that can be approached only by faith. And when you get there, all you find is yourself. The beauty or terror you experience is your understanding of how far you’ve come, your being stretched further than is humanly possible.<br>\n The fiction lover agrees. She says, Yes, of course. The novel is a large thing. The novel stands against the backdrop of human existence just as mountains dominate the landscape. But stories are simple things, small aspects of human foibles and quirks. A story can be held in a glance or a half- remembered dream.<br>\n It’s a good argument, and I wouldn’t refute it. But I will say that if novels are mountains, then stories are far-flung islands that one comes upon in the limitless horizon of the sea. Not big islands like Hawaii, but small, craggy atolls inhabited by eclectic and nomadic life forms that found their way there in spite of tremendous odds. One of these small islets can be fully explored in a few hours. There’s a grotto, a sandy beach, a new species of wolf spider, and maybe the remnants of an ancient culture that came here and moved on or, possibly, just died out.<br>\n These geologic comparisons would seem to support the fiction reader’s claim that novels and short stories are different categories, distant cousins in the linguistic universe. But where did those wolf spiders come from? And who were the people who came here and died? And why, when I walk around this footprint of land, do I feel that something new arises with each day? I eat fish that live in the caves below the waves. I see dark shadows down there. I dream of the firmament that lies below the ocean, the mountain that holds up that small span of land.<br>\n I cannot climb the mountain that sits in the sea, but from where I stand it comes to me in detritus and dreams.<br>\n Short story writers must be confident of that suboceanic mountain in order to place their tale in the world. After all, fiction mostly resides in the imagination of the reader. All the writer can do is hint at a world that calls forth the dream, telling the story that exhorts us to call the possibility into being.<br>\n The writers represented in this collection have told stories that suggest much larger ideas. I found myself presented with the challenge of simple human love contrasted against structures as large as religion and death. The desire to be loved or to be seen, represented on a canvas so broad that it would take years to explain all the roots that bring us to the resolution.<br>\n In many of the stories we find exiles, people who have lost their loved ones, their homelands, their way. These stories are simple and exquisite, but they aren’t merely tales of personal loss. Mothers have left us long before the mountains were shifted by southward-moving ice floes. Men have been broken by their dreams for almost as long as the continents have been drifting. And every day someone opens her eyes and sees a world that she never expected could be there.<br>\n These short stories are vast structures existing mostly in the subconscious of our cultural history. They will live with the reader long after the words have been translated into ideas and dreams. That’s because a good short story crosses the borders of our nations and our prejudices and our beliefs. A good short story asks a question that can’t be answered in simple terms. And even if we come up with some understanding, years later, while glancing out of a window, the story still has the potentiall to return, to alter right there in our mind and change everything.</p>\n<p>—Walter Mosley</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2003 by Houghton Mifﬂin Comppany....

Does a journey of sexual discovery have to be quite this filthy? But if Cordell's misadventures were too palatable, if this were a novel one could read over lunch, it wouldn't be authentic porn.

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Charles Taylor</h4><i>Killing Johnny Fry</i> is a frankly pornographic novel, and I mean that as a compliment. It would be unfair to what Mosley is attempting here - to put sex at the center of Cordell’s existence and to turn the reader on in the process - to describe the sex scenes with that wan word “erotica,” a word almost always used to demonstrate that the user is above those coarse enough to be aroused by mere pornography. And judged solely by its intentions to appeal to what prosecutors in obscenity cases used to call the prurient interest, the novel is a success. Good porn is tough to write and when talented writers decide it shouldn’t be left to the hacks, the result can be something as joyous as Nicholson Baker’s <i>Vox</i> and <i>The Fermata</i>. Or even something as voluptuously smutty as the porn-for-cash Alexander Trocchi turned out for Maurice Girodias’s Olympia Press.<br>\n— The New York Times\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Tracy Quan</h4>When a national treasure like Mosley decides to publish a dirty novel, snippy reactions are inevitable. Does a journey of sexual discovery have to be quite this filthy? But if Cordell's misadventures were too palatable, if this were a novel one could read over lunch, it wouldn't be authentic porn. Fans of his Easy Rawlins series might be put off by the surreal absurdity, but perhaps Mosley is reaching out to new readers. Or, like Bill Clinton, a fan of Mosley's early work, perhaps he's doing something audacious because he can.<br>\n— The Washington Post\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly</h4>Mosley returns from the vastly underrated Fortunate Son and from Fear of the Dark with a piece of what one might call \"deep erotica\": there's plenty of sex, and also plenty of motivation for it within protagonist Cordel Carmel's travails and ruminations, as far-fetched as they can get. After a charged-but-chaste lunch with young Lucy Carmichael (a blonde in her early 20s looking to be introduced to Cordel's art agent friend), Cordel, 45, walks in on Joelle (his longtime, non-live-in girlfriend): Joelle's being very consensually sodomized by a white man wearing a red condom, their (very well-endowed) mutual acquaintance, Johnny Fry. Cordel walks out quietly, without being seen. In short order, Cordel buys a porno video and gets enraptured with its sadist star, Sisypha; quits his freelance-translation gig; has conflicted, amazing sex with Joelle (who continues to lie to him); has unconflicted, amazing sex with Lucy (who seems very nice) and with voluptuous neighbor Sasha Bennett (who seems way crazy); meets Sisypha for an Eyes Wide Shut-like experience; seduces the young, ghetto Monica Wells; and finally, within the week, has his confrontation with Johnny Fry. Though it all, Cordel's thoughts on humiliation, submission, pain, family, aging and abuse manage to sustain the wisp-thin plot of this total male fantasy. (Jan.) Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Like his last two adult novels (The Wave and Fortunate Son), Mosley's latest is a departure from his best-selling Easy Rawlins mysteries. His protagonist, 45-year-old translator Cordell Carmel, considers himself lucky that girlfriend Joelle is so undemanding that they spend only one night a week together. Stopping by Joelle's apartment unannounced one day, he discovers her with another man, aspiring musician Johnny Fry. That night, Cordell buys his first X-rated DVD and begins a journey of sexual self-discovery. Watching The Myth of Sisypha, the vividly described adult film he has purchased, opens Cordell's eyes to a world of sex and power, pleasure and pain. He explores his renewed sexual energy with a young photographer he's helping, an attractive neighbor, a French student he meets on the subway, and Sisypha herself. Mosley's decision to subtitle the book \"a sexistenial novel\" implies a more philosophical approach to sexuality than the gratuitous sexual episodes described here. Recommended only for libraries with strong demand for all of Mosley's work.-Karen Kleckner, Deerfield P.L., IL Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>And now for something completely different from Easy Rawlins' prolific creator (Cinnamon Kiss, 2005, etc.), who's branching out into still another genre. Cordell Carmel, a middle-aged New York translator everybody calls \"L,\" decides one afternoon on his way to a conference to wait a few hours for a first-class train to Philadelphia. Heading over to girlfriend Joelle Petty's apartment, he finds her sharing a frantic embrace with Johnny Fry, a white man who'd like to switch from being a personal trainer to playing classical guitar. Instead of calling attention to himself, L leaves quietly (though he does turn back briefly when he thinks Jo is crying out in pain) and proceeds to pull down the edifice of his carefully constructed life. He smashes his hand against a brick wall, orders a high-fat meal, buys an expensive bottle of cognac and takes home a porn video, The Myth of Sisypha, that puts him in touch with his appetite for passion and pain. The next day, after missing the conference and infuriating his agent, L begins to grab every chance at a new life. He reinvents himself as an agent for photographer Lucy Carmichael, flirts with female acquaintances and takes three of them to bed, then returns to Jo bent on getting some of the kind of wild, crazy sex she's been enjoying with Johnny. But it's The Myth of Sisypha that has the most profound impact on L, and when he has a chance to meet the video's star and embark on a series of scenarios that cross the line from NC-17 to XXX, his obsessions with getting off and killing Johnny are joined by another kind of desire as tender as it is unlikely. An interesting look at a male in midlife crisis. As L says, \"I had come alive. And lifehurt.\"Agent: Gloria Loomis/Watkins Loomis Agency Inc.\n\n</article>"

      "synopsis": "<p><p>Originally published in 1993, this pioneering anthology is a powerful polemic for fundamental cultural change&#58; the transformation of basic attitudes about power, gender, race, and sexuality. This edition adds new pieces on Internet pornography, the role of sports in sexual violence, and rape as a calculated instrument of war. The diverse contributors, which include bell hooks, Andrea Dworkin, Michael Messner, Yvette Flores, and Ntozake Shange, are activists, opinion leaders, theologians, policymakers, educators, and authors of both genders who tackle such hot-button issues as pornography and the intersection of race and rape. <p>The book's statistics have been thoroughly updated, as have essays about sexual violence in K-12 schools and in the church. New pieces from within America's immigrant communities depict struggles with domestic violence, sexual harassment, and community stigmas against reporting rape. This violence, not limited to one race, creed, or nationality, has its roots in cultural biases that are still much in need of change.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The contributors to this invaluable sourcebook share the conviction that rape is epidemic because our society encourages male aggression and tacitly or overtly supports violence against women. Cumulatively, these 34 essays by such figures as Gloria Steinem, Andrea Dworkin, Ntozake Shange, Michael Kimmel and Louise Erdrich situate rape on a continuum extending from sexist language to pornography, sexual harassment in schools and the workplace, wife battering and date and marital rape. Most of the selections were written for this volume. Highlights include a proposal to make rape a presidential election issue, an analysis of the churches' ambivalent response to societal violence, guidelines for raising boys to view themselves as nurturing, nonviolent fathers and inspirational visions of personal or institutional change.

      "overview": "<p>Robert Frost never felt more at home in America than when watching baseball \"be it in park or sand lot.\" Full of heroism and heartbreak, the most beloved of American sports is also the most poetic, and writers have been drawn to this sport as to no other. With <b>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</b>, The Library of America presents the story of the national adventure as revealed through the fascinating lens of the great American game.</p>\n<p>Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor-league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play in the era before Jackie Robinson shattered the color line. Unforgettable portraits of legendary players who have become icons-Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron-are joined by glimpses of lesser-known characters such as the erudite Moe Berg, who could speak a dozen languages \"but couldn't hit in any of them.\"</p>\n<p>Poems in <b>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</b> include indispensable works whose phrases have entered the language-Ernest Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat\" and Franklin P. Adams's \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\"-as well as more recent offerings from May Swenson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Martin Espada. Testimonies from classic oral histories offer insights into the players who helped enshrine the sport in the American imagination. Spot reporting by Heywood Broun and Damon Runyon stands side by side with journalistic profiles that match baseball legends with some of our finest writers: John Updike on Ted Williams, Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio, Red Smith on Lefty Grove.</p>",
      "excerpt": "As a young man, Charles Emmett Van Loan (1876-1919) worked at a meat packing company and went to minor-league baseball games around Los Angeles with his boss. He began taking notes on what he saw, and when he converted them into dispatches and submitted them to the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i>, he was on his way to becoming California's best baseball writer. He worked for the <i>Los Angeles Morning Herald</i> in 1904, and then for the <i>Denver Post</i>, where he met Damon Runyon. By 1910, the two men were house mates in New York, colleagues at the sports department of the American. Over the next nine years Van Loan's journalism and short stories about boxing, horseracing, golf, Hollywood, and of course baseball appeared in a number of publications, including <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, for which he served two stints as an editor. During the first, he became the editorial conduit for Ring Lardner's humorous sketches that would later be collected as the novel <i>You Know Me Al</i>. This piece, published in <i>The Outing</i> magazine in 1909, shows Van Loan's ample humor and his sophisticated understanding of the skills involved in baseball. The portraits of Ty Cobb and Hal Chase are especially interesting since they provide glimpses of the two players before a reputation for recalcitrance (Cobb) or dishonesty (Chase) overtook them.\n<p><b>Baseball as the Bleachers Like It</b><br>\n<b>By Charles E. Van Loan</b></p>\n<p>The man in the box office, whose swift, money-changing fingers play on the pulse of the amusement-loving public, will tell you that a baseball franchise in a large city is a \"mint.\" The man in the box office cares little for sport; he views it with the sordid eye of one who thinks in figures and dreams in dollars. Those who make a study of the great business of providing amusement for a nation, will tell you that where other outdoor sports and \"attractions\" count their devotees by tens, baseball drags its hundreds and even thousands through the turnstiles. There must be some good reason for this state of affairs.</p>\n<p>The same men sit on the bleachers day after day, their straw hats tilted down over keen eyes, their fingers fumbling score cards and pencils. Everything that the gallery is to the stage, the bleachers are to the diamond. The most merciless critic may be found somewhere behind first or third base where he can see everything which happens. The grand stand may be all very well for the thin-skinned ones who must mingle personal comfort with their amusement; the true baseball fan sits on the bleachers, trimmed down to his shirt sleeves. No wire nettings in front of him, if you please.</p>\n<p>Why is he there day after day? He can hope to see nothing absolutely new, for in the present high stage of its development, professional baseball has reached a point where one new play a season is the average. What is the lure of this mighty magnet -- this thing, half sport, half business, which draws its millions of dollars every year?</p>\n<p>Is it the science of the game -- the inside baseball?</p>\n<p>Nine tenths of the men who go to the theater hope for one of two things: they want to be amused or thrilled. The problem play does not appeal to the man who has found life its own problem.</p>\n<p>The man who goes to the race track for an afternoon's sport and does not sell his interest for a bookmaker's ticket hopes to see a great race with a nose-and-nose finish and three horses driving at the wire.</p>\n<p>Patrons of the gentle art of the lamented Queensberry, hoot two clever men, who spar for points without damage or gore. These are the same men who make baseball profitable; what then do they see in the national game?</p>\n<p><b>PROBLEM PLAYS ON THE DIAMOND</b></p>\n<p>For example: it is the ninth inning; the score is 1 to 0, and it has been a battle of the pitchers from the clang of the gong. There have been a few scattering hits, a few brilliant bits of individual fielding, and many weak flies hoisted into the air. It has been a very scientific contest from first to last -- so full of science that there has been little else. Ask your bleacher friend what he thinks of that sort of a game.</p>\n<p>\"We-ell,\" he will say, \"Matty was good today and so was the other fellow. We won, of course, but...\"</p>\n<p>Behind that \"but\" lurks the secret of the whole thing, the power of the game over its millions of devotees. The melodrama had been lacking; the sensational plays which stir the blood, the long sharp hits and the brilliant catches. It had been a problem play with two stars in the cast and sixteen walking gentlemen.</p>\n<p>Now then, watch your friend in the last half of the eighth inning with the score 3 to 2 against the home team, two men out and the bases filled. It has been a slashing contest, full of free hitting, sharp fielding, and the brilliant double plays which hold the score in small figures.</p>\n<p>The hard-hitting outfielder of the home team is at bat. Your friend is out on the edge of his seat. Any sort of a safe hit means a tied score; a long single might win the game, and a double... your friend hopes for a double! Watch his eyes when the umpire's right arm jerks upward as the first ball splits the plate.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, what was he waiting for? Might have known the first ball would be a groover!\" Your friend seems peevish.</p>\n<p>One ball. Wild cheering. Two balls. A demonstration and yells of \"Going Up!\" Ah! He missed that one! Well, he still has the big one left. Three balls.</p>\n<p>From the box back of first base comes the sharp bark of the coacher.</p>\n<p>\"Three and two now, ole boy! Three and two! Make him be good!\"</p>\n<p>Watch your friend now. He has stopped breathing. His cigar is dying an unpleasant death. He does not care. Three and two! He has eyes and ears and a taste for one thing only -- the drama spread out before him.</p>\n<p>Once more the gray-clad pitcher cuddles the ball to his chest, nodding slightly in answer to the catcher's signal. Up goes his foot, back goes his body from the hips, a forward lunge, and the arm snaps out in a half circle like a powerful spring uncoiled. The ball flies straight for the catcher's mitt and at the same instant the three base runners flash into motion. Three and two and two men down -- nothing to do but run.</p>\n<p>The batter pivots with a mighty swing, there is a splitting crack as wood meets leather, and a white dot shoots out over the second baseman's head, mocking his futile leap. The center fielder is sheering off toward right, racing with a forlorn hope and the right fielder, wiser still, is already on his way toward the fence.</p>\n<p><b>DELIRIUM ON THE BLEACHERS</b></p>\n<p>How about your friend now? There he is, standing up in his place and tearing the air with a series of Comanche war whoops. All around you men, and women too, are screaming unintelligible words. The man beside you who gave you such a nasty look when you stepped on his feet, hammers you between the shoulder blades and bellows into your ear:</p>\n<p>\"A triple with bases full! A triple! What do you know about that, eh?\"</p>\n<p>What is the attraction in baseball? Your answer is out there on the bleachers, several thousand strong. Those leaping, howling, white-shirted dervishes have given it to you. It is the melodrama which makes baseball.</p>\n<p>A baseball fan will go to a dozen poor games rather than miss that sort of a play, and when at last he recovers his breath he will tell you that he is amply repaid for his time and money.</p>\n<p>The scientific contest interests him because he understands every move in the game, but if you want to bring him to his feet, you must give him melodrama.</p>\n<p>Inside baseball? Yes, he knows something of that, too. He has made a study of inside baseball, sitting above the great masters. He recognizes and appreciates good pitching, but the thing which brings him to his feet with the howl of a timber wolf is the long clean drive to the fence, or the seemingly impossible catch. The melodrama \"gets\" him every time.</p>\n<p>One of the grizzled old baseball generals once said:</p>\n<p>\"Give me a team of sluggers and I'll chance the errors.\" He knew what the fans wanted to see.</p>\n<p>Ask the first youngster you meet to name the two greatest baseball players in the two big leagues. Nine times out of ten the answer will come like a flash:</p>\n<p>\"Hans Wagner and Ty Cobb!\"</p>\n<p>These are the names of the two great batters, Wagner in the National and Cobb in the American League.</p>\n<p>The tenth youngster may take time to think and give you another answer. If you lift his hat you will find that youth has a high, intellectual brow. He will enjoy problem plays when he grows up.</p>\n<p>The leading men of this national melodrama form interesting contrasts. Some of them have found it a long road from the sandlots to the pay roll of a big league team; others jumped into fame in a single week. Personal appearance counts for nothing; nationality counts for nothing; it is the man who \"delivers the goods\" who is always sure of his welcome from the lynx-eyed critics on the sunny seats.</p>\n<p>Baseball fans are quick to recognize and identify the thing which we call \"class.\" After your bleacher friend has watched a visiting team through an entire series he can place his finger on the weak spot in the organization; he can tell you how the games were lost and which players lost them.</p>\n<p>Of the ball players who have jumped into prominence at a single bound, two might be mentioned: Hal Chase and Tyrus Cobb.</p>\n<p><b>CHASE BREAKS INTO FAST COMPANY</b></p>\n<p>A few years ago the Los Angeles team of the Pacific Coast League had need of a substitute first baseman. Frank Dillon, first baseman and team captain, had signed a contract to play with the Brooklyn club of the National League. Dillon was anxious to remain in California and did not report with the Eastern team for spring practice.</p>\n<p>The manager of the Southern team, looking about him for a substitute player, engaged a boy from a small college team in central California, devoutly hoping that he might not have any use for him.</p>\n<p>On the opening day of the league season, Dillon went out on the field to put the team through the preliminary practice, playing his old position at first base. The substitute sat on the bench. His face was unknown to the Southern baseball fans who immediately dubbed him a \"bush leaguer\" and forgot about him. The youngster sat there on the bench, nursing an odd-shaped pancake glove; a battered relic contrasting strangely with his new flannel uniform and spiked shoes.</p>\n<p>It was his first appearance in \"organized baseball.\" Success meant a chance to earn money; failure meant a ticket back to the prune orchards of Santa Clara County.</p>\n<p>The gong clanged, announcing the opening of the game. The umpire drew a paper from his pocket, showed it to Dillon, and the captain and first baseman slowly left the field. He had been informed that every game in which he played would be declared forfeited. Baseball magnates have many ways of protecting themselves in business deals; Dillon had signed with Brooklyn and Brooklyn meant to have him.</p>\n<p>The long-legged country boy arose and ambled out to Dillon's old position. The stands were in an uproar. Dillon had been the idol of the baseball public; the best first baseman in the league and the brainiest team captain the town had ever had. The contagion spread to the Los Angeles players, not one of whom had confidence in the raw college boy, thus thrust into an important position.</p>\n<p>It would be hard to imagine a more unfortunate first appearance. The game opened with a rush. The first batter smashed a ground ball at the Los Angeles shortstop and tore down the line to first base. Mechanically the shortstop raced over, dropped his glove in front of the ball, and faced about to make the throw to first base. Instead of Dillon, there was the \"bush league kid\" on the bag.</p>\n<p>The base runner was a fast man; in the twinkling of an eye the thing had been done -- the panic was working. Instead of the perfect line \"peg\" to first base, the shortstop threw fully eight feet outside the bag and correspondingly high, shooting the ball with the speed of a rifle bullet. It would have been a vicious throw for a right-hander to care for, even though on his glove-hand side; the bush league boy was a left-handed player and wore the glove on his right hand. The ball was coming to his bare hand and coming with such speed that there was little chance to hold it, even if a man cared to risk injury by reaching for a wide ball with the bare hand.</p>\n<p><b>\"ACCIDENT\" THAT BECAME A HABIT</b></p>\n<p>With the fraction of a second in which to decide what to do, the country boy whirled with his back to the diamond, hooked the spikes of his left shoe in the bag, and thrust out a long right arm for a backhand catch. The runner was beaten a stride on a circus catch which few big-leaguers would care to attempt.</p>\n<p>After the cheering, the bleacherites decided that it had been a blind, back-hand stab or a lucky accident. Twenty minutes later every man inside the grounds knew that he was seeing first base played as no youngster had ever played it before. The infield, still in a state of panic, threw the ball high, wide, and on both sides of him, but the flat pancake glove was always there when it arrived.</p>\n<p>The boy covered the ground with great loose-jointed strides, dug up impossible ground balls beyond the reach of an ordinary fielding first baseman, picked line drives out of the air, nipped bunts ten feet from the plate, caught advancing runners, and capped the climax by starting and finishing a double play thought to be possible with only one first baseman in America, Fred Tenney of the Nationals. There was but one verdict at the end of the game; the boy was the greatest first baseman ever seen on the Pacific Coast. He found his place in a single afternoon.</p>\n<p>On the next opening day, the youngster wore a New York uniform. New York had heard of him as a marvel and a boy wonder, but New York accepts no verdict except her own. In less than a week Hal Chase was the baseball sensation of the season, and baseball critics burned up columns in an attempt to analyze his method of playing his position. In the end everybody agreed that it was not possible to understand a raw boy who broke into the fastest company in the business, ready-made, as it were. The veterans of the American League could not teach him anything about inside ball; he was a revelation to his team mates and a terror to opposing clubs.</p>\n<p>Chase is still the premier first baseman of the country and the great star of baseball melodrama. He makes his plays by some unerring instinct which must have been born in him, and when it comes to handling bad throws at first base, there never was a player like him. Time after time he has been seen to turn his head away from a lowthrown ball and jam his glove down, making a blind catch of a ball which he could not have followed with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Fielders have little trouble with ground balls, but this is because they can move about and suit the catch to the bound of the ball. The first baseman is anchored to the bag; he must play the ball as it comes to him or miss the base runner.</p>\n<p>Other men have had more years of experience; many players are better at postmortem analysis of a baseball problem, but when a ball is hit down to Hal Chase, you will see the bleachers come up as one man. The fans never know what he is going to do with the ball when he gets it, but they do know that there will be no fumbling or \"booting,\" but a chain-lightning play directed at the one spot where the most damage can be done. Chase is the personification of baseball by instinct and the most popular first baseman the country has ever seen.</p>\n<p><b>\"TY\" COBB'S FIRST BASEBALL MONEY</b></p>\n<p>\"Ty\" Cobb was not so fortunate in his beginning. Tyrus was born in Georgia and early decided to be a semi-professional ball player. The difference between a professional and a semi-professional is that the former has a stated salary and always gets it, while the latter takes what he can get when he can get it.</p>\n<p>Young Cobb walked six miles in the hot sun to play his first \"money\" game. When the receipts had been counted, Cobb's share was one dollar and twenty-five cents. He walked six miles to his home and on the way decided that there was a future in professional baseball.</p>\n<p>The Charleston team secured him. He was a wild, erratic youngster who could bat like a demon, but never knew when to stop running bases. It is just as important to know when to stop running as it is to know when to begin. He gained the reputation of a crazy base runner and Charleston sold him to Augusta for one hundred and fifty dollars and was glad to get the money.</p>\n<p>Augusta tried him and found the same fault. He could hit, but he was wild and discipline irked him. He was a firebrand on the team and he would fight on the field or off. Ty won and lost several battles with the Augusta players and then the management sold him to Detroit for seven hundred dollars -- the greatest bargain in the history of the game.</p>\n<p>In Detroit young Mr. Cobb, the firebrand, found men who made baseball a study. It was a slugging team, but mixed with the hitting was the judgment which wins games. The players took a hand in taming that hot Southern blood. They argued with him, but as Ty would rather fight than argue, most of the debates ended on the floor of the dressing room. Those cool, seasoned veterans of the Tiger team knew that in Cobb they had a phenomenon, so they went at him methodically, literally \"licking him into shape.\" Some of them fought him more than once. Even to this day McIntyre plays left field and Cobb right field, because it is necessary to keep these two stars as far apart as possible.</p>\n<p>Cobb has lost most of his rough edges. He has gone out of the rough-and-tumble business; he sheds no more blood in defense of his principles. He knows when to quit running bases, hits the ball hard and often, and makes doubles on hits which any other man would call legitimate singles.</p>\n<p>He is as fast as a thunderbolt on the lines and the most daring man on a slide that baseball has seen in many a day. His slim, wiry legs are covered with bruises from April until October and he is always slightly lame until he hits the ball; then he forgets his soreness. Absolutely fearless, of great hitting ability, and a fighter every inch, Cobb is one of the great drawing cards in the baseball of today.</p>\n<p><b>THE MAN WHO HITS EVERYTHING</b></p>\n<p>Then there is the veteran Hans Wagner whose big stick has kept Pittsburgh in the first division for more years than he cares to remember. Hans is the last man in the world who would be taken for a great ball player. On appearance, he might be a piano mover. Immensely broad from shoulders to hips, awkward of gait, long armed, and bowlegged, this great German has won his place in baseball by his uncanny ability to hit the ball harder and more often than any living man.</p>\n<p>Hans is no moving picture either in the field or at bat, but once he connects with the ball he becomes a human whirlwind. National League pitchers dream about him and call it a nightmare. The lucky man who strikes him out receives an ovation, for he has done something.</p>\n<p>The only ball which worries Hans is the spit ball. He does not care for the wet ones, but they are all alike after he hits them. One of the spit ball artists of the National League has this to say about Wagner:</p>\n<p>\"He'll hit anything anywhere. No pitcher ever scares him. He may hate to see you wetting that ball and when you say to him:</p>\n<p>\"'This is IT, you big Dutchman!' his eyes will get about as big as butter plates, but if he hits it! GOOD NIGHT!\"</p>\n<p><b>THE MOST SENSATIONAL OF ALL</b></p>\n<p>The most sensational play ever made? Every fan will give a different answer to this question. Some will say that Chase made it when he saved a game by racing into the middle of the diamond on a pop fly, reaching the ball when it was only a few inches from the grass. Ed Walsh, the Chicago White Sox pitcher, thinks it was made at Detroit two years ago.</p>\n<p>It happened in the game in which Walsh broke the Detroit hoodoo. The Tigers had beaten Walsh every time he faced them. They regarded him as their lawful prey. The game was played in Detroit, and Mullin, who started this season with eleven straight victories for the Tigers, was slated to pitch against Walsh.</p>\n<p>Early in the contest George Davis, the veteran shortstop of the Chicago club, secured the only hit made off Mullin and it was enough to win the game. The ball, driven down the first base line into right field, struck a fire hose lying in the grass and bounded into the bleachers for a home run. After that Mullin was invincible.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the game, Detroit opened with the usual rally. Rossman, Detroit's first baseman, leading off in the inning, smashed the ball against the fence for a clean triple. \"Dutch\" Schaefer drew a base on balls. Schmidt, next at bat, gave the hit-and-run sign and, with both runners in motion, hit a hard bounder down toward third base where Tannehill of Chicago was playing. Tannehill made a perfect scoop and threw the ball to the plate twenty feet ahead of Rossman, who seeing that he was caught, doubled back on the line, hoping to dodge the tag long enough to allow Schaefer to reach third.</p>\n<p>Sullivan raced down the line with the ball, driving Rossman before him. Rossman slipped and fell close to third base and just as Sullivan tagged him for the first out, Schaefer slid to third. In the meantime, Schmidt, a slow runner because of an injury to his ankle, had rounded first base and was well on his way to second. Sullivan straightened up and whipped the ball to Rohe who was covering second base and calling for the throw.</p>\n<p>As Schmidt slid, Rohe's arm came down with a thump and Schmidt made the second out. The instant Sullivan threw the ball, Schaefer was on his feet and dashing home from third base. The plate had been left unprotected; Sullivan was down near third base. Walsh, the pitcher, yelled for the ball and raced Schaefer to the rubber, closely followed by George Davis. The two runners collided in front of the plate.</p>\n<p>Walsh was stunned and Schaefer was thrown ten feet from the plate, alighting on his shoulders. Davis, who arrived about the same time, took the throw and dropped the ball on the struggling Tiger, completing the third out and the most sensational triple play ever made in the big leagues.</p>\n<p>George Davis, who is a scientist, says that it was not a clean triple, but every man at the ball park went home talking about it in whispers. It is the melodrama of the game which counts in the penciled statement of the autocrat of the box office.</p>",
      "synopsis": "<p>Robert Frost never felt more at home than when watching baseball, \"be it in park or sand lot.\" Full of heroism and heartbreak, the most beloved of American sports is also the most poetic, and writers have been drawn to this sports as no other. With <i>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</i>, The Library of America presents the story of the national adventure as revealed through the fascinating lens of the great American game. <p> Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor-league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play in the era before Jackie Robinson shattered the color line. Unforgettable portraits of legendary players who have become icons -- Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron -- are joined by glimpses of lesser-known characters such as the erudite Moe Berg, who could speak a dozen languages \"but couldn't hit in any of them.\" <p> Poems in <i>Baseball: A Literary Anthology</i> include indispensable works whose phrases have entered the language -- Ernest Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat\" and Franklin P. Adams's \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\" -- as well as more recent offerings from May Swenson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Martin Espada. Testimonies from classic oral histories offer insights into the players who helped enshrine the sport in the American imagination. Spot reporting by Heywood Broun and Damon Runyan stands side by side with journalistic profiles that match baseball legends with some of our finest writers: John Updike on Ted Williams, Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio, Red Smith on Lefty Grove.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Dawidoff, the author of a well-regarded biography of Moe Berg (The Catcher Was a Spy), has assembled this collection of exemplary baseball writing. While acknowledging the literature's formative years with early boosters such as Albert Spalding and other \"dead ball\" era writers, he concentrates on its mature period, from Ring Lardner through the two Rogers (Kahn and Angell) of the modern era, even Don Delillo and Stephen King. Dawidoff smartly doesn't rule out a great piece of baseball writing merely because it's familiar: classics like Updike's account of Ted Williams's final 1960 game, Gay Talese's Esquire profile of the unknowable Joe DiMaggio, and W.C. Heinz's salute to the recklessly brave Pistol Pete Reiser belong in any anthology worth its pitching rosin. This wonderful introduction belongs alongside past collections such as The Armchair Guide to Baseball. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>From Barnes & Noble</h4>Can we praise this anthology enough? Over the last century, baseball has evoked superb writing from many of our most gifted authors: John Updike; Don DeLillo; Bernard Malamud; Marianne Moore; Thomas Wolfe; William Carlos Williams. Library of America editor Nicholas Davidoff has tracked down the best of these, not neglecting baseball mavens such as Roger Angell, Roger Kahn, Ring Lardner, and James T. Farrell. Digging deep, he's discovered pieces we never knew about, such as Amiri Baraka's joyful reminiscences of watching the Negro Leagues' Newark Eagles and Red Smith's touching tribute to southpaw Lefty Grove.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Library Journal</h4>Dawidoff, the author of a well-regarded biography of Moe Berg (The Catcher Was a Spy), has assembled this collection of exemplary baseball writing. While acknowledging the literature's formative years with early boosters such as Albert Spalding and other \"dead ball\" era writers, he concentrates on its mature period, from Ring Lardner through the two Rogers (Kahn and Angell) of the modern era, even Don Delillo and Stephen King. Dawidoff smartly doesn't rule out a great piece of baseball writing merely because it's familiar: classics like Updike's account of Ted Williams's final 1960 game, Gay Talese's Esquire profile of the unknowable Joe DiMaggio, and W.C. Heinz's salute to the recklessly brave Pistol Pete Reiser belong in any anthology worth its pitching rosin. This wonderful introduction belongs alongside past collections such as The Armchair Guide to Baseball. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>Kirkus Reviews</h4>An intelligently selected and diverse collection of the best baseball poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, to be published on opening day of the Major League season. Author, prolific magazine contributor, and former college shortstop Dawidoff (The Catcher Was a Spy, 1994) assembles excellent verse and prose about baseball for this long-overdue Library of America anthology. As he notes in his introduction, baseball has historically touched everyone who grew up in the US, and many of our best authors wrote about it; our national pastime, Dawidoff argues, has become an integral part of our literary landscape and American heritage. He makes a strong case for this idea by including verse by poets from Carl Sandburg and William Carlos Williams to Robert Frost and Marianne Moore. To further demonstrate the sport's cultural significance, Dawidoff includes prose from such preeminent novelists as Thomas Wolfe, Bernard Malamud, John Updike, and Annie Dillard. Additionally, he uncovers gems from the most unlikely sources: Stephen King produces a heartrending chronicle of his son's little league team's quest for the 1987 Main State Championship; Negro League legend Satchel Paige divulges his six rules for staying young. Dawidoff captures our history's tense and ambiguous racial undercurrents in excerpts from works like Amiri Baraka's The Autobiography of Leroi Jones. He demonstrates the enduring resonance of baseball fiction by showing that classics like Ernest Lawrence Thayer's \"Casey At the Bat\" and Ring Lardner's You Know Me Al hold their own when compared to modern baseball writing like Yusef Komunyakaa's poem \"Glory\" and Don DeLillo's Underworld. This collection resurrects scintillating fragments ofyouthful summers and ultimately convinces readers that reflecting on baseball helps us understand our complicated national identity. Of obvious appeal to baseball fans of all ages, but also a delight for general readers-and worthy of attention from scholars serious about American history and literature.\n\n</article>"

      "author_bio": "<p><P>The editor of <i>More Mirth of a Nation&#58; The Best Contemporary Humor,</i> Michael J. Rosen has been called the unofficial organizer of the National Humor Writer's Union, a pretty good idea for an organization that could offer all kinds of benefits to its struggling members (currently numbering more than 300 who have never been published in <i>The New Yorker</i> or aired on NPR). He has been called other things as well, like in third grade, and then in seventh grade especially, by certain older kids known as \"hoods,\" who made his life miserable, specifically during gym class, lunch period and after school. Later, much later, the <i>Washington Post</i> called him a \"fidosopher\" because of his extensive publications on dogs, dog training, and dog-besotted people. The <i>New York Times</i> called him an example of creative philanthropy in their special \"Giving\" section for persuading \"writers, artists, photographers and illustrators to contribute their time and talents to books\" that benefit Share Our Strength's anti-hunger efforts and animal-welfare causes. As an author of a couple dozen books for children, he's been called...okay, enough with the calling business.<P>For nearly twenty years, he served as literary director at the Thurber House, a cultural center in the restored home of James Thurber. Garrison Keillor, bless his heart, called it (sorry) \"the capital of American humor.\" While there, Rosen helped to create The Thurber Prize for American Humor, a national book award for humor writing, and edited four anthologies of Thurber's previously unpublished and uncollected work, most recently <i>The Dog Department&#58; James Thurber on Hounds, Scotties</i> and <i>Talking Poodles,</i> happily published by HarperCollins as well.<P>In his capacity as editor for this biennial, Rosen reads manuscripts year round, beseeching and beleaguering the nation's most renowned and well-published authors, and fending off the rants and screeds from folks who've discovered the ease of self-publishing on the web. Last summer, Rosen edited a lovely book, <i>101 Damnations&#58; The Humorists' Tour of Personal Hells;</i> while some critics (all right, one rather outspoken friend) considered this a book of complaints, Rosen has argued that humor, like voting and picketing and returning an appliance that \"worked\" all of four months before requiring a repair that costs twice the purchase price, humor is about the desire for change. It's responding to the way things are compared to the way you'd like things to be. And it's a much more convivial response than pouting or cornering unsuspecting guests at dinner parties.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><P><b> <center>More seriously funny writing from American's most trusted humor anthology </center></b> <P>Witty, wise, and just plain wonderful, the inaugural volume of this biennial, Mirth of a Nation, ensured a place for the best contemporary humor writing in the country. And with this second treasury, Michael J. Rosen has once again assembled a triumphant salute to one of America's greatest assets&#58; its sense of humor. More than five dozen acclaimed authors showcase their hilariously inventive works, including Paul Rudnick, Henry Alford, Susan McCarthy, Media Person Lewis Grossberger, Ian Frazier, Richard Bausch, Amy Krouse Rosenthal, Nell Scovell, Andy Borowitz, and Ben Greenman &#151; just to mention a handful so that the other contributors can justify their feelings that the world slights them. <P>But there's more! <i>More Mirth of a Nation</i> includes scads of Unnatural Histories from Randy Cohen, Will Durst's \"Top Top-100 Lists\" (including the top 100 colors, foods, and body parts), and three unabridged (albeit rather short) chapbooks&#58;<P><blockquote>David Bader's \"How to Meditate Faster\" (Enlightenment for those who keep asking, \"Are we done yet?\")<P>Matt Neuman's \"49 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth\" (for instance, \"Make your own honey\" and \"Share your shower.\") <P>Francis Heaney's \"Holy Tango of Poetry\" (which answers the question, \"What if poets wrote poems whose titles were anagrams of their names, i.e., 'Toilets,' by T. S. Eliot?\") <P></blockquote><P>And there's still more&#58; \"The Periodic Table of Rejected Elements,\" meaningless fables, Van Gogh's Etch A Sketch drawings, a Zagat's survey of existence, an international baby-naming encyclopedia, Aristotle's long-lost treatise \"On Baseball,\" and an unhealthy selection of letters from Dr. Science's mailbag. And that's just for starters! Just remember, as one reviewer wrote of the first volume, \"Don't drink milk while reading.\"</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Regular readers of the New Yorker's Shouts & Murmurs page and the Modern Humorist will likely have already digested some of the fare in this biennial collection of humor pieces, nearly all of which have been published elsewhere. Though big names like Steve Martin and Bruce McCall are trumpeted on the cover, the real treats can be found in the work of less famous contributors. Francis Heaney's \"Holy Tango of Poetry,\" which imagines the results of poets writing poems whose titles are anagrams of their names-e.g. \"I'm Leery Jocks\" by Joyce Kilmer, or \"Toilets\" by T.S. Eliot (\"Let us go then, to the john,/ Where the toilet seats wait to be sat upon\")-is irresistibly goofy. Tim Carvell's account of his solo attempt at being a Neilsen family (he manufactured a couple of kids and wife named Gladys and made them all Eskimos) should be required reading for anyone who has ever longed to lie on annoying questionnaires. And Jeremy Simon's parody of an existential Zagat's guide is a witty send-up of a city staple (the entry for the opposable thumb reads: \"While this 'innovative' evolution-a 'pick-up joint' for the klutzy-is valued by locals for 'synergy' with its surroundings, dissenters dis it as 'overrated' 'finger food'\"). Silly lists, \"unnatural histories,\" fake correspondences and countless other oddball selections round out this amusing volume. (Nov.) Copyright 2003 Cahners Business Information.</p>",

The collection ranges from poems, riddles and reader's theater to brief biographical or historical articles. A few selections such as \"Ten Little Bunnies\" or \"A Nonsense Poem\" are more the old-fashioned reader fare, with no clear character as American. However, the patriotic, virtue-oriented flavor of the biography of Clara Barton is typical of most of the selections. Many selections are prefaced by a vocabulary of key words though rather oddly, no definitions are given here or in a glossary. The large type and the many illustrations are likely to make this most attractive to primary schoolers; by fifth or sixth grade it will have very much the feel of a \"little kid's book.\" Children who are fascinated with history might enjoy this. This book is a pleasant addition to a classroom library.\n\n</article>"

      "overview": "<p>When a restaurant review referred to a Filipino child as a \"rambunctious -little monkey,\" Filipino Americans were outraged. Sparked by this racist incident, <i>Screaming Monkeys</i> sets fire to Asian American stereotypes as it -illuminates the diverse and often neglected history and culture within the Asian American diaspora. Poems, essays, paintings, and stories break down and challenge \"found\" articles, photographs, and headlines to create this powerful anthology with all the immediacy of social protest. By closely critiquing a wealth of material, including the judge’s statement of apology in the Wen Ho Lee case, the media treatment of serial killer Andrew Cunanan, and the image of Asian Americans in major U.S. marketing campaigns, <i>Screaming Monkeys</i> will inspire all its readers.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>From essays about the Quaker Christian experience and the \"mystery at the core of all being\" to a murder mystery by Irene Allen, this collection presents some of the best of contemporary Quaker nonfiction and fiction writing, with a brief biography of each author. Among these popular 20th- and 21st-century writers are names familiar to readers of mainstream Christianity, including Thomas Kelly, Jessamyn West, James Michener, Daisy Newman, Jan de Hartog, and Scott Russell Sanders. These adept essays and works of fiction reflect the true scope of spiritual experience, offering essays and fiction that range from t<%END%>er, thought-provoking, and challenging to humorous, dramatic, and mysterious.<P>Author Biography&#58; <i>J. Brent Bill</i> is the associate director of the Indianapolis Center for Congregations. He is the assistant book review editor for <I>Fri<%END%>s Journal</I> and director of the Ministry of Writing Annual Colloquium at Earlham School of Religion. He lives in Plainfield, Indiana.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>It's high time the traditional Publishers of Truth as Quakers originally called themselves published something for today's general readers outside the Quaker fold. Bill's anthology picks up where the Quaker Reader (edited by novelist Jessamyn West) left, focusing on writings from the latter half of the 20th century. The prose mix is lively: nonfiction devotional slices from modern mystic Thomas Kelly are served up along with such fiction as an excerpt from the murder mystery Quaker Testimony by Irene Allen, pen name for geologist Elsa Kirsten Peters. Such dizzying range makes the point that contemporary Quakers liberal, pastoral, evangelical can be mildly or wildly different despite common core beliefs in peace, simplicity, truth telling and ongoing divine revelation. At the same time it offers excerpts from such better known Quaker believers as James Michener and Richard Foster, the anthology introduces such unsung writers as children's book specialist Elfrida Vipont Foulds, one of a notably large cadre of women who have always been empowered in Quaker tradition to speak or write. Anthologies are necessarily arbitrary, acknowledges editor Bill, an Earlham College writing program graduate who provides helpful biographical introductions. Still, the influential writer-educator Parker Palmer should have been included. However, this collection is a welcome reminder that the small Society of Friends, as Quakers are also known, continues to offer creative and relevant witness to the truth as found within and practiced in community.

Such dizzying range makes the point that contemporary Quakers liberal, pastoral, evangelical can be mildly or wildly different despite common core beliefs in peace, simplicity, truth telling and ongoing divine revelation. At the same time it offers excerpts from such better known Quaker believers as James Michener and Richard Foster, the anthology introduces such unsung writers as children's book specialist Elfrida Vipont Foulds, one of a notably large cadre of women who have always been empowered in Quaker tradition to speak or write. Anthologies are necessarily arbitrary, acknowledges editor Bill, an Earlham College writing program graduate who provides helpful biographical introductions. Still, the influential writer-educator Parker Palmer should have been included. However, this collection is a welcome reminder that the small Society of Friends, as Quakers are also known, continues to offer creative and relevant witness to the truth as found within and practiced in community.

Selections come from James Michener, Jessamyn West, Jan de Hartog, and Elizabeth Gray Vining. Each selection is furnished with biographical and critical introductions. Standouts include the piece by Thomas R. Kelly and a murder mystery excerpt by Irene Allen. For most collections. Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.\n\n</article>"

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>Americas Review</h4>The pioneering journal of Hispanic literary arts, which has nurtured the early careers of many now-famous authors -- celebrates its 25th anniversary with this anthology of some of the best fiction, poetry, and visual art from its pages.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Publishers Weekly\n                                 - <span class=\"author\">Publisher's Weekly</span>\n                            </h4>Since 1972, the Americas Review (formerly Revista Chicano-Riquena) has presented prose, verse, essays and visual art by Latinos living in the U.S.; this anthology celebrates the magazine's 25th birthday by reprinting work from its pages. TAR editor Flores divides her 27 prose writers and 52 poets into three stages meant to illustrate the development of Latino writing, from early concerns with group representation and political impact to more recent formal experiments. First-generation writers like Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, Tomas Rivera and Lucha Corpi strove to unify and engage Hispanic cultures through literature; some of them wrote in Spanish, in forms called \"estampas\" (brief sketches). Rudolfo Anaya, Sheila Ortiz-Taylor, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Pat Mora and Alurista produced autobiographical works that code-switched effortlessly between English and Spanish. Second-generation writers like Julia Alvarez, Denise Chavez, Alberto Rios and Ana Castillo later achieved broader recognition; their early work, reprinted here, demonstrates both their craft and sophistication, and their awareness of audiences both Latino and Anglo. Flores calls the third generation of U.S. Latino writers \"New Navigators of the Floating Borderlands\"; Kathleen Alcala, Sandra Benitez, Rane Arroyo and their coevals use their expanded technical resources to describe familiar elements of the U.S. Hispanic experience: family, language, inheritance, displacement, immigration issues, gender, myth, citylife. Readers will appreciate the breadth of Flores's selections. Others will regret the absence of Sandra Cisneros and Gary Soto (a footnote implies that Flores tried to include them); others may ask why neither biographical nor explanatory notes accompany the stories and poems. Still, this is a volume that's long overdue: readers (and teachers) seeking a good, wide-ranging anthology of short works by U.S. Latinos will be glad this book exists. (Feb.)\n\n</article><article>\n    <h4>School Library Journal</h4>YA-An excellent anthology that celebrates the 25th anniversary of the journal of the Hispanic literary arts, The Americas Review. With the publication of this collection of short fiction and poetry, mature readers of Spanish and English can trace the emergence of contemporary Hispanic voices in the U.S. Organized into three sections, the volume represents three distinct stages of the cultural identity of American Hispanics: \"Nationhood Messengers\" (pioneer writers, 1970-1984); \"Memory Makers\" (the 1980s); and \"New Navigators of the Floating Borderlands\" (the 1990s). While the pieces are written predominantly in English, secondary Spanish students will also find sufficient fare to challenge them. Among the most interesting of the pioneering writers' contributions is Miguel Algar n's \"Paterson,\" evocative of William Carlos Williams's long epic of the same name. From the contemporary prose segment, Elenza Diaz Bjorkquist's short story, \"The Hershey Bar Queen,\" will fascinate YAs because of its unrelenting honesty. Modern themes arise: women's issues, the immigrant experience, urban travel, farm-laborers' experiences, etc. In addition, the 16 images in the art plates add much to the presentation. An important contribution to cultural studies of Hispanics in America.-Margaret Nolan, W. T. Woodson High School, Fairfax, VA Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>Booknews</h4>This anthology celebrates the 25th anniversary of The Americas Review, a journal of Hispanic literary arts. Selections are arranged in three parts: Nationhood Messengers, from the Latino communities of the 1970s; Memory Makers, polished works successful in the American mainstream from the 1980s; and New Navigators of the Floating Borderlands, featuring emerging writers just beginning to be heard. Includes both prose and poetry, in Spanish and English. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.\n\n</article>"

He edited <i>Finding Home: Writing on Nature and Culture from Orion Magazine</i>, and he is a contributing editor of the splendid journal of nature writing <i>Orion: People and Nature</i>. The following essay from <i>Orion</i> explores the nature of place and the place of nature in New York City. Sauer discovers an urban Galapagos of animals rarely noticed by city dwellers, explores the \"peaceable kingdom\" of the American Museum of Natural History, and reflects on the design of Central Park. In his natural history of this part of the city, he investigates the possibility that a brook has been buried. Throughout the essay, Sauer articulates a complex and integrated view of nature that includes urban life and museum displays, culture and wildness, past and present.</p>\n<p>For three evenings in June the sun sets directly between the buildings that form the canyon walls of West 78th Street and projects long shadows of people crossing the street all the way up the gently sloped blacktop pavement, from Broadway, across Amsterdam and Columbus Avenue, east to the American Museum of Natural History. During the last two minutes before the sun drops beneath the Palisades above the far shore of the Hudson River, its light beams in horizontally, close to the ground, flickering as it passes between the moving taxis, cars, and trucks north- and south-bound on Broadway, steady in the intervals when traffic signals stop them. I timed my dog walks to coincide with this event, hurried out when the air was clear, zigzagged back and forth across the street and up the block, stopping when the traffic stopped, to see how far the shadow of the family's little dog would stretch and if mine would be cast as far as the museum's west wall, which in this light glows like the headwall of a ceremonial Anasazi canyon.</p>\n<p>Like summer's first light blinking through the aperture of moving traffic, there was a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't quality to every aspect of the natural history I learned while living on West 78th Street. Wildness itself seemed modulated, as if rewired through an urban black box to add layers of human artifice to every manifestation of its force, and the neighborhood flora and fauna could be classified by these distortions: The museum biota-mounted specimens, skeletons, glass models, and plaster casts-represented natural history heavily laced with nineteenth-century, pre-anthropological empire building. The splendidly abundant Central Park biota-especially of migratory birds-in its trampled but nevertheless fantastical pastoral landscape, represented nature annually amplified by art and enthusiasm. The gutsy, entrepreneurial, street biota, less noticed and less fashionable, ignored by science-except for that of commercial exterminators and municipal rat and pigeon controllers-seemed mine alone to study and celebrate as the wildest, most contemporary music of all.</p>\n<p>House sparrows nested in looted parking meters; kestrels in a hole in a high decorative minaret of brick. The spiders were organizing exterior building walls into mutually exclusive, stratified life zones: from the first to the third, the fourth to the seventh, and the eighth floor and above. One summer, in a London plane tree that a winter storm had shoved precariously over the middle of the street, robins constructed a nest festooned with ribbons of glistening video- and black and yellow police-line tape that dangled over the hot pavement like the tentacles of a tree-dwelling Caribbean jellyfish and fluttered in the slipstream of every passing delivery truck, as if grasping for escaping prey. While I watched, this resilient gypsy biota was constructing its own urban Galapagos.</p>\n<p>The first street birds to sing in the spring were house finches, descendants of caged birds imported from western mountain slopes and released in Long Island City by a pet wholesaler after Congress passed a law prohibiting trade in native species. Separated from their natural habitat, and the biological pool from which their ancestors had sprung, the West 78th Street finches belonged to a yet unrecognized species, an inchoate evolutionary work-in-progress, developing, on this block anyway, a predisposition for nesting in and under exterior window air conditioning units. As several species of Old World insects also colonized these appliances, I imagined a twenty-first century Darwin would discover that the window finches had become cockroach carnivores.</p>\n<p>Compared to life on the street, the museum's version of nature and humanity was peaceable kingdom. Natural biota and primitive people co-existed as faunal partners in ecosystems disconnected from the present and unhinged from their pasts. Bits and pieces of captured moments were displayed like snapshots in a sprawling album. The dusty mahogany-skinned, larger-than-life Northwest boatpeople have been pushing their heroic ocean-going war canoe eastward through the museum's 77th Street lobby for at least as long as since I was a child. A diorama, in the Teddy Roosevelt Wing as I recall, displays a group of now-endangered East Asian pygmy rhinos, labeled (since the 1930s) with a credit to the cooperative colonial bureaucrats who granted the museum's permission to collect them. Every corner of the world is presented as it might have appeared in the summer of its discovery. The full-sized whale suspended over the Hall of Fishes poises at the silent edge of a gentle dive into the last instant of a pristine, unpolluted sea.</p>\n<p>In contrast, east of the museum-the same direction the canoeists are heading-through the entrance called Naturalists Gate, Central Park teems with living biota in a landscape constructed to make nature a cultural event. Here, the spring bird migrations arrive as bright waves of prehistoric bits of gossamer protoplasm dropping nightly from vernal skies to feed, and rest, and fill up this wood with song, and to be greeted by a spontaneous, running, voice-over, interpretive commentary, involuntarily delivered by hundreds of euphoric birders. One late-May morning in the Ramble section of Central Park, an authoritative voice spoke from the underbrush: \"Did you get a good look at it?\" it asked-of whom I was not sure-and without waiting for a reply, explained: \"The yellow warbler is the only <i>yellow</i> warbler with yellow feather shafts.\" The migration is thoroughly covered by experienced observers; no detail, no rare individual goes unremarked. For several years, the cop on the Central Park beat was a birder, who scootered through the chilly morning wood with a walkie-talkie and binoculars around his neck, stopping in strategic places to peer into the brush, as though assigned to radio his sightings into a registry at headquarters. Once, a squad of hardy, country-booted, camera- and scope-toting birders directed me to a rare Brewster's warbler. It was just beyond the far northeast edge of the Ramble, they informed me, \"along the West Drive, in the cherry branch that hangs over the sixth guardrial post north of a Sabrett's hot dog vendor.\"</p>\n<p>It was.</p>\n<p>Central Park, Olmsted's masterpiece of earth-moving legerdemain, allows one to be immersed in nature, yet never at a far remove from a deli. Passing through the park's distinctive gray stone perimeter wall at Naturalists Gate, for example, one is immediately at treetop level, crossing the high, arched Buttress Bridge, from which the entry road descends into an oak and wisteria Victorian lakeshore forest. The city is out of sight; its sounds, muffled by foliage, give way to water lapping. A second footbridge crosses a lagoon to a rise on the north shore; the Ramble, where, on a good day, the warblers are as rainforest-dense as are the birds in any zoo on earth.</p>\n<p>For almost a decade, the three biota, of street, museum, and park, appeared utterly disparate and unrelated. I had no clue how to imagine a coherent ecosystem for them, until I began looking for the West 78th Street Brook and its headwaters.</p>\n<p>In the city, natural forces are elusive. Except when Con Ed certifies that lightning striking a substation in far-away northern Westchester has triggered a blackout, disasters are blamed on political, economic, social, or cultural forces. For example, less regularly than the annual migration, but every few years, the boiler room of our building filled with water and we were without hot water and heat for two or three chilly April days. Though these floods coincided with unusually wet springs following snowy winters, I read them as service interruptions; standard West Side conspiracies-the greedy landlord, super, and fuel oil company gouging each other to gouge me. The surprising possibility that the floods were a natural phenomenon was introduced to me by Bob Napoli, the building's most independent superintendent, and the only super I ever trusted to be in cahoots with no one.</p>\n<p>During the twenty years I resided in the thick-walled, prewar apartment building, on the south side of the block between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, its operations, including the machinations of the boiler bellowing in all seasons from beneath the lobby floor, were in the charge of a succession of superintendents who, with union blessings, came and left like itinerant workers birddogging their ways across the five boroughs toward retirement seasons in Florida. With a sense of place as peripatetic as their lives, all but one defined the building's location solely by its interchangeable couplings to the city's sewers, conduits and mains, which were also the absolute boundaries of their union certification and job responsibilities. Bob Napoli was the exception. Wherever he went, his leery constitution demanded a geographic context. He loved talking about places where the lay of the land was visible; Bear Mountain Park; his wife's family's place in Puerto Rico, or the ex-urban homestead his grown son had settled, no doubt following paternal instincts. A year after Bob Napoli arrived on 78th Street, he showed me the three-and-a-half-foot-deep bunker-like trench in the floor of the portion of the boiler room that lay beneath the sidewalk. \"This was constructed,\" he declared, as we stood inside it, \"to catch the flood of a brook that used to flow here and allow it to drain away without disabling the furnace. It worked,\" he added, voicing admiration for the builder, \"until the city's storm drains clogged.\"</p>\n<p>Tantalized by a possible geological dimension that might add continuity to the neighborhood's disorderly natural history, I set about to find additional evidence to support the Brook Hypothesis, to build a theory so circumstantially elegant that April water erupting from the basement floor would be as compelling evidence for the existence of the brook as observations of starlight being bent by the sun's gravity were of relativity.</p>\n<p>The lower course of the brook was easy to imagine. Seventh-eighth Street lies in a shallow valley between the low hills of 77th and 79th Streets. The same tilt toward the river that elongates solstice shadows in June carries January's modern glacial ooze of meltwater, slush, and street detritus down from Columbus Avenue to Broadway. There it pools over backed-up storm drains, turns sluggishly northward to 79th Street and Broadway, and turns again, to cascade down a steep slope toward the 79th Street Boat Basin at the edge of the Hudson in Riverside Park. Without the two sharp corners, this was, I decided, the brook's approximate course.</p>\n<p>Tracing the brook upstream, east of Columbus Avenue, to its headwaters, presented more difficulty. From the American Museum of Natural History, across Central Park West and into Central Park, the original land surface has been transformed by at least three major city-building constructions. The museum sits in the middle of an enigmatic plain that, at first glance, resembles the low bed of a former pond. The depression is an illusion, however, created by an excavated truck ramp on the building's west side and by a slight ridge that rises to its east, which, though it appears to be a natural divide, is almost certainly made of fill left over after the tunnel that carries the \"A\" train was cut beneath Central Park West. East of Central Park West, opposite the museum, the land surface drops abruptly on the inside of Central Park's perimeter wall to about twenty feet below street level. If the top of the watershed had been a pond where the museum now stands, the surface of land offered no evidence of it nor of the original direction of the drainage.</p>\n<p>Before the Upper West Side of Manhattan became a city neighborhood it was old farmland, which fallowed, awaiting development, had become a squatters' shantytown. The eviction of the squatters and the construction of the streets happened at about the same time that Frederick Law Olmsted built Central Park and the first museum building was erected on its adjacent parcel of park land.</p>\n<p>In a photograph displayed at the museum, taken at a time when squatters' huts still stand in the neighborhood and work on the park is well underway, the first museum building sits alone in a dry and dusty landscape. To its west a grid of city streets has been raised as causeways, high enough above the old farmland's surface that digging basements for the buildings that will fill the empty blocks requires no more than a few feet of excavation. No water is visible along 78th Street, though the photograph does show a shadow of a valley there, in which, it appears, the elevation of a stream in flood stage would be above that of the present boiler room floor.</p>\n<p>East of the tiny museum in the photograph, Central Park stretches as a barren horizonless moonscape, across which hundreds of men and wagons are redistributing cubic acres of earth into a new terrain-hills, valleys, and a lake, being imagined and reified by human tectonics. The crater that will be Central Park Lake is under construction, and the land surrounding it is being regraded to drain into it. I had my clue.</p>\n<p>By the time he began designing Central Park, the city had already tapped upstate mountains for drinking water, and Olmsted was free to use Manhattan water as pigment for his landscape. The key to understanding the natural history of the neighborhood I was experiencing was not where the local water had flowed, but how it had been valued and used. Replaced by mountain water, local water, with which squatters presumably washed their feet, had become commercially superfluous, collectable nature, to be used as decoration, or homeless nature, to be ignored and piped away.</p>\n<p><i>Continues...</i><br>\n<br>\n<i>Continues...</i> <br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<hr noshade size='1'>\n <font size='-2'>Excerpted from <i>At Home on the Earth</i> by <i>David L.

      "overview": "<p>For those whose familiarity with black women playwrights is limited to the works of Lorraine Hansberry and Ntozake Shange, this collection of 15 plays written between 1925 and 1985 by eight authors will be a revelation. They express a passionate longing for social justice and for a stable, nurturing relationship between black men and women. Introductions for each author provide biographical information and critical analyses. A useful bibliography of plays and secondary sources is also included. This anthology helps to fill a serious gap in the standard histories of American drama. <i>Library Journal</i></p>\n<p><i>Wines in the Wilderness</i> brings together thirteen plays by black women from the 1920s to the present, including works by Marita Bonner, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Eulalie Spence, May Miller, Shirley Graham, Alice Childress, Sonia Sanchez, Sybil Kein, and Elizabeth Brown-Guillory. The plays and dramatists selected are representative of and have made considerable contributions to African American theater.</p>\n<p>Although the works of these playwrights span over sixty years, they are closely linked by the theme of women struggling to define their roles in society. The heroines speak out against interracial and intraracial biases, stereotyping, lynch mobs, illiteracy, poverty, promiscuity, self-righteousness, abusive men, rape, and miscegenation. Each play is preceded by a critical introduction that includes biographical information, an assessment of the playwright's contributions to black theater, and a synopsis and critical analysis of the play. The bibliography that follows the plays provides selected lists of published plays, produced plays, and anthologies. An index completes the work. This collection represents an effort to make available plays written by black women that have not been published or are now out of print. In recovering these plays, scholars will now be able to take a close look at the contributions that black women dramatists have made not only to African American theater, but to American theater in general.</p>",

The heroines speak out against interracial and intraracial biases, stereotyping, lynch mobs, illiteracy, poverty, promiscuity, self-righteousness, abusive men, rape, and miscegenation. Each play is preceded by a critical introduction that includes biographical information, an assessment of the playwright's contributions to black theater, and a synopsis and critical analysis of the play. The bibliography that follows the plays provides selected lists of published plays, produced plays, and anthologies. An index completes the work. This collection represents an effort to make available plays written by black women that have not been published or are now out of print. In recovering these plays, scholars will now be able to take a close look at the contributions that black women dramatists have made not only to African American theater, but to American theater in general.</p>",

      "editorial_reviews": "<article>\n    <h4>The New Yorker</h4>The work assembled by the Southern Californian poet Charles Harper Webb in <i>Stand Up Poetry: An Expanded Anthology</i> isn't afraid to have a sense of humor. \"Why I Want to Be the Next Poet Laureate,\" by Elliot Fried, mocks the establishment: \"I want a frail consumptive woman, just a bit deranged, / waiting patiently in a dark room as I come home / after a hard day, flinging Guggenheim and Ford Foundation / grants onto the vacuumed shag. I want to write quatrains / for the sensitive.\" Webb's original anthology, subtitled \"The Poetry of Los Angeles and Beyond,\" was published in 1990 and focused on locals. Here he opens the ranks to irreverent, crowd-pleasing Easterners like Billy Collins and James Tate -- writers he admires for creating \"bizarre and outrageous alternative worlds.\"<i>(Dana Goodyear)</i>\n\n</article>\n\n<article>\n    <h4>KLIATT</h4>Webb writes in his introduction: \"Whatever the reasons, mainstream poetry has in the past fifteen years moved much closer to the Stand Up aesthetic.\" He defines Stand Up poems as ones that work well orally, are frequently characterized by a sense of humor, are sometimes irreverent and are \"honest, unpretentious and strong.\" They're not anti-literary and are written for the printed page, so are not to be confused with performance/ slam poetry. Many of these poems, though, would be good performance pieces. The Beat poets were the precursors of this style. The poetry is also characterized by the use of \"natural language,\" fanciful tone and the creation of bizarre worlds. The poems are infused with strong emotion, often have a narrative bent and reflect aspects of urban and popular culture. They are accessible rather than obscure. There are many poets represented in the collection. Some are well known, such as Billy Collins, Charles Bukowski and Pattiann Rogers; others, less so. But they mostly have strong voices and the poems hit with emotional force. Christopher Buckley's \"Sleep Walk\" is a nostalgic lament on teenage love in the '50s, with references to the music of the period: \"...—and though we barely moved across/ the carpet to the Statues and \"Blue Velvet,\" sparks/ stung our hands and pulled us into a world where/ you could get lost in no time....\" Denise Duhamel in \"Ego\" recreates the feeling of incredible smallness a third grader might experience during an astronomy lesson with an orange, lemon and flashlight, her being \"...merely a pinprick in one goosebump on the/ orange.\" Playful irreverence describes John Gilgun's \"Ars Poetica,\" in which he pokes fun at what makes a good poem.Form varies from tightly constructed four-line stanzas to prose poems. Amy Gerstler's chilling prose poem, \"An Unexpected Adventure,\" uses the cultural icon of Nancy Drew, always competent, who in a surprise twist is raped. This collection is an unexpected adventure. Not all the poems are funny but all present us with somewhat skewed perceptions of the world that are all too real.

      "synopsis": "<p>For many women, memories of their grandmothers open up a Pandora's box if thoughts, feeling, and images. Filled with poems, stories, photographs, this anthology reveals the rich variety of these connections, as writers such as M.F.K. Fisher, MargaretAtwood, Isabel Allende, and Maya Angelou explore their relati onships with their grandmothers. Photos.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This engaging collection of short pieces of autobiography, fiction and poetry, some published previously, deals with the grandmother-granddaughter relationship. According to Kack-Brice, a California clinical social worker, memories of grandmothers, whether positive or negative, are a powerful connection to childhood, and the exploration of these reminiscences can lead to deeper self-knowledge. Many of the selections, including the poetry of Marge Piercy and Linda Hogan and memoirs by Ethel Barrymore and Maya Angelou, evoke grandmothers as figures of strength and inspiration. Other contributors, such as M.F.K. Fisher and Stephanie Patterson, describe more troubled relationships with their grandmothers. A touching selection by Jewelle Gomez recalls how her grandmother accepted her lesbianism. Exercises for the reader who wants to write about her own grandmother are provided by the contributors.

From the gutter to the penthouse, inner city to outer burb, from the Third World coca farmer to the executive addict, coke is the lifeblood of a global black economy and an outlaw underground. Coke has also been dark muse, torment, and theme to many of our greatest writers. White Lines gathers these literary thrill seekers in a classic and contemporary snort through the fog- and fear-filled streets of Victorian London to the dance macabre of the post-Vietnam culture of the 1970s, from the couch of Dr. Freud and the bacchanal of Mr. Magus, Aleister Crowley, to the narcotic thrill of fin de siecle casino capitalism, White Lines takes you into illicit and artificial worlds, near wild heavens and then deep, down underground. Selections from writers like Irvine Welsh, Bret Easton Ellis, William S. Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Kim Wozencraft, Terry Southern, Sigmund Freud, Arthur Conan Doyle, Peter Biskind, and Julia Phillips are featured.</p>",

Two entries from Richard Rudgely's Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances set up the reader with some basic facts: \"the cultural story of coca,\" a plant that has played a respected role in Andean culture for thousands of years, \"was radically different from that of the crass glitzy beginnings and subsequently sordid short life of its extract cocaine.\" First isolated in 1860, cocaine enjoyed a few decades of positive press. It was imbibed by Queen Victoria, carried by the first man to fly across the English Channel, and used in Coca-Cola. Sigmund Freud's article \" ber Coca\" displays the generally favorable attitude typical of those years, relating the doctor's personal experiences and outlining cocaine's uses in treating disorders ranging from digestive problems to alcohol and morphine addiction. From there we move through some less enthusiastic texts, including Arthur Conan Doyle's account of Sherlock Holmes craving the drug's stimulation from \"The Sign of the Four\" and Aleister Crowley's story of drug-fueled debauchery in Paris (\"Au Pays de Cocaine\"). Then the editors let the veil drop completely. William Burroughs gets creepy with \"Coke Bugs,\" Charles Nicholls recounts a drug deal gone decidedly wrong in \"A Night with Captain Cocaine,\" and in an excerpt from his autobiography, Miles Davis recalls being so paranoid when coked up that he regularly looked for people hiding under the radiator. Hollywood is also well represented, with desperate accounts by Julia Phillipsand Carrie Fisher, among others; bad boys Brett Easton Ellis and Jay McInerney turn up as a matter of course; and Stephen King provides the single breath of air in the oppressive atmosphere with a three-page account of how he kicked his addiction. Evidence that cocaine has provided a lot of good writers with some very ugly experiences.</p>",
